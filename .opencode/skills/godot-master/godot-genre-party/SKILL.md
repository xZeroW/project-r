description: "Expert blueprint for party games including minigame resource system (define via .tres files), local multiplayer input (4-player controller management), asymmetric gameplay (1v3 balance), scene management (clean minigame loading/unloading), persistent scoring (track wins across rounds), and split-screen rendering (SubViewport per player). Use for Mario Party-style games or WarioWare collections. Trigger keywords: party_game, minigame_collection, local_multiplayer, asymmetric_gameplay, split_screen, dynamic_input_mapping."

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Multiplayer & Input
- NEVER hardcode player inputs to specific joypad IDs (e.g., 0 or 1); strictly query dynamically via `Input.get_connected_joypads()`.
- NEVER bake player-IDs into the input map (e.g., "p1_jump"); strictly use a **Dynamic Input Router** to map physical controllers to players at runtime.
- NEVER use `Input.is_action_pressed()` for assigning new player joins; strictly parse raw `InputEventJoypadButton` in `_unhandled_input()` for device metadata.
- NEVER allow inconsistent controls between games; strictly standardize across all minigames (**A = Accept/Action**, **B = Back/Cancel**, **Joystick = Move**).
- NEVER assume a disconnected joypad removes a player; strictly connect to the `joy_connection_changed` signal to pause and handle dropouts gracefully.
- NEVER use boolean polling for analog sticks; strictly use `Input.get_vector()` for precision and deadzones.

### User Experience & Feedback
- NEVER use long text-based tutorials; strictly use a **3-second looping GIF** + a single-sentence instruction overlay (e.g., "Mash A to fly!").
- NEVER ignore "Asymmetric" balance in 1v3 games; strictly provide the "One" with unique abilities or increased HP/speed to offset the numerical disadvantage.
- NEVER neglect Accessibility and Handicap systems; strictly implement optional support (e.g., speed boosts for lower-skilled players) to keep the competition social.
- NEVER leave UI Control nodes with `FOCUS_NONE` for gamepad menus; strictly set to `FOCUS_ALL` with explicit focus neighbors for accessible navigation.

### Rendering & Architecture
- NEVER use heavy scene transitions; strictly keep minigame assets light and use **Threaded Background Loading** while the instructions screen is active.
- NEVER draw global `CanvasLayer` UI for individual split-screen players; strictly use per-viewport `CanvasLayer` children.
- NEVER manually set sizes on `SubViewport` children; strictly use `GridContainer` or `BoxContainer` for automatic split-screen layout.
- NEVER store tournament state or scores inside minigame scenes; strictly use a **Persistent Autoload** (Singleton).
- NEVER use a static `Camera2D` for shared-room games; strictly use a **dynamic group camera** that zooms/pans to fit all players in frame.
- NEVER overlap `SubViewportContainer` nodes without setting `mouse_filter` to `PASS`; otherwise, top viewports will block input.

## Core Loop
1. **Lobby join** → 2. **Meta/board** → 3. **Minigame** → 4. **Score** → 5. **Repeat**

## Decision Trees

### Input & dropout
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Lobby join + route | **MANDATORY** [party_input_router.gd](scripts/party_input_router.gd) |
| Runtime `pN_*` remaps | [local_input_manager.gd](scripts/local_input_manager.gd) |
| Pad battery death mid-game | **MANDATORY** [connection_monitor.gd](scripts/connection_monitor.gd) — pause tree + reconnect overlay |

### Scenes & viewports
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Cycle minigames | **MANDATORY** [minigame_orchestrator.gd](scripts/minigame_orchestrator.gd) (+ [deferred_scene_switcher.gd](scripts/deferred_scene_switcher.gd)) |
| Prefetch during how-to | [minigame_async_loader.gd](scripts/minigame_async_loader.gd) |
| 2–4 split | [split_screen_setup.gd](scripts/split_screen_setup.gd) — per-viewport CanvasLayer; `mouse_filter` on containers |
| Shared camera party | [shared_party_camera.gd](scripts/shared_party_camera.gd) |

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Input | `godot-input-handling` | 2–4 local controllers |
| 2. Scene | `godot-scene-management` | Load/unload minigames |
| 3. Data | `godot-resource-data-patterns` | Minigame `.tres` defs |
| 4. UI | `godot-ui-containers` | Lobby / score / reconnect |
| 5. Balance | `godot-monte-carlo-balancer` | Asymmetric 1v3 power |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Shared `jump` action | Device-bound `pN_*` via router / local_input_manager |
| Global CanvasLayer in split | Per-SubViewport UI layers |
| Generic screen-shake Elite | Prefer split + reconnect procedures above |

## Split-screen + reconnect procedure
1. Build viewports with [split_screen_setup.gd](scripts/split_screen_setup.gd).
2. Bind devices through [party_input_router.gd](scripts/party_input_router.gd) before the minigame starts.
3. Keep [connection_monitor.gd](scripts/connection_monitor.gd) alive as Autoload; on disconnect pause and `call_group("ui_overlays", "show_reconnect", device)`.
4. On reconnect, re-bind the same `player_id` → new `device_id` then unpause — do not remap other players.

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [party-elite-implementations.md](references/party-elite-implementations.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Minigame Definition
Using Resources to define what a minigame is.

```gdscript

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **SubViewport**: Powerful for 4-player split-screen. Each player gets a camera, all rendering the same world (or different worlds!).
*   **InputEventJoypadButton**: Use `Input.get_connected_joypads()` to auto-detect controllers on the Lobby screen.
*   **Remapping**: Godot's `InputMap` system can be modified at runtime using `InputMap.action_add_event()`. Creating "p1_jump", "p2_jump" dynamically is a common pattern.
