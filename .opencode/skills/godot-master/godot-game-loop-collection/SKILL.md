## NEVER Do (collection landmines)

- **NEVER reuse or omit stable collectible IDs** — Duplicate IDs double-count or overwrite; missing IDs break completion % and saves.
- **NEVER count the same Area overlap twice** — `body_entered` can re-fire on re-entry; gate with "already collected" / one-shot disable of monitoring.
- **NEVER persist NodePaths as the identity of collectibles** — Paths break on scene moves; save **IDs** (StringName / int), not `get_path()`.
- **NEVER soft-lock the last item** — If compass / spawn logic depends on "remaining > 1", the final pickup becomes unfindable.
- **NEVER store hunt progress only in scene-local nodes** — Level reload wipes progress; keep collected set in [collection_manager.gd](scripts/collection_manager.gd) + save.
- **NEVER `queue_free()` collectibles with zero juice and no ID commit** — Commit ID first (signal), then VFX, then free.
- **NEVER scale collectible collision shapes non-uniformly** — Breaks overlap math; edit shape resources.
- **NEVER hardcode spawn positions in code** — Use Marker3D / designer points with [hidden_item_spawner.gd](scripts/hidden_item_spawner.gd).
- **NEVER drive collection truth from UI silhouettes** — Archive UI mirrors manager state; manager is authoritative.
- **NEVER load massive levels synchronously on hunt complete** — use threaded `ResourceLoader` (see references).
- **NEVER manipulate SceneTree from worker threads** — `call_deferred` only.

## Golden Path (MANDATORY)

1. [collectible_item.gd](scripts/collectible_item.gd) — `item_id` (unique) + `collection_id` (hunt), one-shot Area pickup
2. [collection_manager.gd](scripts/collection_manager.gd) — authoritative collected-ID set via `register_item()` + `get_remaining_ids()`
3. [collection_compass.gd](scripts/collection_compass.gd) — nearest node whose `item_id` is still in manager remainders
4. Persist collected IDs via [godot-save-load-systems](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-save-load-systems/SKILL.md)

Optional: [hidden_item_spawner.gd](scripts/hidden_item_spawner.gd) for randomized hunts; [collection_loop_patterns.gd](scripts/collection_loop_patterns.gd) for advanced loop/MainLoop helpers.

## Available Scripts (full set)

- [collectible_item.gd](scripts/collectible_item.gd) — **MANDATORY** pickup actor; export stable `item_id` per instance and hunt `collection_id`
- [collection_manager.gd](scripts/collection_manager.gd) — **MANDATORY** progress brain; `start_collection(id, item_ids)` then `register_item(id, item_id)`
- [collection_compass.gd](scripts/collection_compass.gd) — **MANDATORY** when guiding players; wire `collection_manager` and query `get_remaining_ids()`
- [hidden_item_spawner.gd](scripts/hidden_item_spawner.gd) — designer markers / chance spawns (Do NOT Load for fixed placed-only hunts)
- [collection_loop_patterns.gd](scripts/collection_loop_patterns.gd) — advanced loop patterns (Do NOT Load for simple ID hunts)

## Expert Collection Patterns

### 1. Persistent Collection (Save/Load)
Serialize the manager’s collected `item_id` set per `collection_id` (`PackedStringArray` via `get_collected_ids()` / `restore_collected_ids()`), not node paths. Reload: manager restores set → collectibles self-disable if `item_id` already owned.

### 2. Collection Archive UI (Silhouettes)
Grid of icons: uncollected `modulate` silhouette; reveal when manager signals that ID. UI never invents collected state.

> **MANDATORY** for threaded loads, MainLoop helpers, and archive/save depth: [collection-loop-advanced.md](references/collection-loop-advanced.md). **Do NOT Load** for simple fixed-ID scavenger hunts.
