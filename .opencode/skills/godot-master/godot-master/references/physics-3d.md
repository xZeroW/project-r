# 3D Physics (Jolt/Native)

High-performance 3D simulation: body choice, CCD, stairs, vehicles, ragdolls, SoftBody — routed through scripts.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER move `PhysicsBody3D` nodes in `_process()`** — Use `_physics_process()`. Moving bodies outside the physics step causes visual jitter and unreliable collision detection [12, 13].
- **NEVER scale collision shapes directly** — Scaling physics shapes causes instability, inaccurate normals, and jitter. Use the `shape` properties (height, radius, size) instead.
- **NEVER modify `RigidBody3D` transforms directly** — This ignores the physics solver. Use `apply_impulse()`, `apply_torque()`, or the `_integrate_forces()` callback for safe manipulation [17].
- **NEVER use `RigidBody3D` for platformer player controllers** — RigidBody is for objects driven by physics. For refined movement, use `CharacterBody3D` with `move_and_slide()` [move_and_slide].
- **NEVER leave Continuous CD (CCD) enabled for static meshes** — It adds heavy CPU cost. Reserve it for high-speed small objects (bullets) to prevent them from passing through walls.
- **NEVER use `PhysicsServer3D` RIDs without manual cleanup** — RIDs are not garbage collected. If you create bodies via the server, you MUST call `free_rid()` when done to avoid memory leaks.
- **NEVER use `RayCast3D` for precise ground detection on stairs** — A single ray is too thin. Use `ShapeCast3D` with a cylinder or sphere shape to detect walkable steps reliably [Stair Logic].
- **NEVER rely on `VehicleBody3D` for non-racing arcade vehicles** — It's a complex sim. For arcade hovercraft or simple cars, a custom `CharacterBody3D` with Raycasts is often easier to tune.
- **NEVER forget to set `collision_layer` and `collision_mask` properly** — If everything is on layer 1, performance will tank from redundant checks. Categorize your world.
- **NEVER use `Area3D` for high-frequency blocking** — Areas are for detection. For walls/barriers, use `StaticBody3D` to ensure immediate, robust containment.

## 3D Layer Pitfalls (not a 2D primer)

- **Layer** = what the object *is*; **mask** = what it *hits*. Name bits in [physics_layers_3d_config.gd](../scripts/physics_3d_physics_layers_3d_config.gd).
- Do not dump a same-as-2D layers tutorial here; Official Docs cover the shared mental model.
