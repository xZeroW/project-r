## NEVER Do (Expert State Rules)

### Hierarchy & Delegation
- **NEVER forget to propagate physics/input to children** — In an HSM, failing to call `child.physics_update()` from the parent's `_physics_process` orphans child logic.
- **NEVER use deep nesting (>3 levels)** — Extreme hierarchy creates "State Spaghetti." If logic is that complex, consider a Behavior Tree or Utility AI.

### Transitions & Lifecycle
- **NEVER call enter() without a preceding exit()** — Skipping exit logic leaves timers, tweens, or audio loops running in the background, causing resource leaks.
- **NEVER modify state during a transition frame** — Re-entrant `transition_to()` calls inside `enter()` cause recursion crashes. Use `call_deferred` if immediate sub-transitioning is required.
- **NEVER hardcode state names as strings** — Typos like `transition_to("Idel")` are silent killers. Use `class_name` based checks OR Constants.

### Architecture & Context
- **NEVER use global singletons for state data** — Coupling states to `GameManager.player_health` makes them non-reusable. Pass a `Context` object.
- **NEVER push states indefinitely** — In a Pushdown Automaton, every `push_state` MUST have a retirement plan (`pop_state`) to avoid stack overflow.
- **NEVER assume state re-entry is always a fresh start** — Resuming from a stack pop should often bypass "Entry SFX/VFX"; use re-entry flags.

## Implementation — Scripts Are Source of Truth

> **Do NOT** copy inline HierarchicalState / push_state samples. Prior body double-`exit()`ed and ignored resume messages.

**MANDATORY route:**
- Hierarchy / physics-input forward: [hsm_hierarchical_base.gd](../scripts/state_machine_advanced_hsm_hierarchical_base.gd)
- Push / pop with `enter({"is_resume": true})`: [hsm_pushdown_stack.gd](../scripts/state_machine_advanced_hsm_pushdown_stack.gd)
- Illegal transition blocking: [hsm_transition_guard.gd](../scripts/state_machine_advanced_hsm_transition_guard.gd)
- Context payload: [hsm_state_context.gd](../scripts/state_machine_advanced_hsm_state_context.gd)

Pushdown contract (from script — single exit, resume msg):

```gdscript
# See hsm_pushdown_stack.gd — do not reimplement
func push_state(state_path: String, msg: Dictionary = {}) -> void: ...
func pop_state() -> void:
    # old.exit(); stack.back().enter({"is_resume": true})
    pass
```

## Expert State Machine Patterns

### 1. HSM Visualizer (Debug Tool)
Use a specialized `Control` node with `_draw()` to visualize the current state stack/hierarchy in the viewport for immediate debugging [3, 11].

```gdscript
class_name HSMVisualizer extends Control
@export var state_machine: Node

func _draw() -> void:
    var font := ThemeDB.fallback_font
    var pos := Vector2(20, 20)
    # Recursively draw active state names...
    draw_string(font, pos, "Active: " + state_machine.current_state.name)
```

### 2. State-Based Audio (Decoupled)
Avoid hardcoding `audio.play()` inside state `enter()` methods. Use a syncer that listens to `state_changed` and maps state names to `AudioStream` resources [12, 13].

```gdscript
class_name StateAudioSyncer extends Node
@export var state_machine: Node
@export var audio_map: Dictionary # { "Jump": preload("jump.wav") }

func _ready() -> void:
    state_machine.state_changed.connect(_on_state_changed)

func _on_state_changed(_old, new_state: Node):
    if audio_map.has(new_state.name):
        $AudioPlayer.stream = audio_map[new_state.name]
        $AudioPlayer.play()
```

### 3. Transition Cost (Utility AI)
Enable states to evaluate their own "weight" based on context. The StateMachine polls sibling costs and transitions to the lowest-cost behavior [17, 18].

```gdscript
# CostState.gd (Base)
func get_cost(context: Dictionary) -> float:
    return 10.0 # Default weight

# UtilityStateMachine.gd
func _physics_process(_d: float) -> void:
    var best_state: Node = current_state
    var low_cost: float = INF
    for child in get_children():
        var cost = child.get_cost(context)
        if cost < low_cost:
            low_cost = cost
            best_state = child
    if best_state != current_state:
        transition_to(best_state.name)
```
