## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY triggers below** — read the matching script; do not paste incomplete Autoload loaders.

- [async_scene_manager.gd](../scripts/scene_management_async_scene_manager.gd) — **MANDATORY** before loading screens / threaded level swaps (`THREAD_LOAD_FAILED` included).
- [background_resource_loader.gd](../scripts/scene_management_background_resource_loader.gd) — **MANDATORY** when preloading the *next* level during gameplay (hitch avoidance).
- [scene_transition_manager.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_transition_manager.gd) — Fade/wipe Tweens wrapping a safe change.
- [scene_pool.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_pool.gd) — **MANDATORY** before frequent spawn/despawn (bullets, enemies, VFX).
- [scene_instancing_pooling.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_instancing_pooling.gd) — Pool fill / reclaim patterns.
- [additive_ui_layering.gd](../scripts/scene_management_additive_ui_layering.gd) — Menus/overlays without destroying the world scene.
- [subviewport_scene_layering.gd](../scripts/scene_management_subviewport_scene_layering.gd) — Parallel worlds / minimaps (`SubViewport` input plan required).

- [node_unparent_reparent.gd](../scripts/scene_management_node_unparent_reparent.gd) — Transform-preserving reparent (never mid-physics blindly).
- [node_path_safe_retrieval.gd](../scripts/scene_management_node_path_safe_retrieval.gd) — `%UniqueName` / guarded `@onready`.
- [dynamic_script_attachment.gd](../scripts/scene_management_dynamic_script_attachment.gd) — Runtime script attach for mods/dynamic entities.

## NEVER Do in Scene Management

- **NEVER load large scenes synchronously** — `load("res://large_scene.tscn")` on the Main Thread causes "hiccups" or full freezes during level transitions. Use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` for async loading with a progress bar.
- **NEVER use `get_tree().change_scene_to_file()` for transient state** — This method purges the current scene and all its local variables. Use an **Autoload (Singleton)** or a persistent 'Game' node to store state across levels.
- **NEVER instance 100+ identical nodes per frame** — Use **Object Pooling** to reuse bullets, debris, or enemies. Constant `instantiate()` and `queue_free()` calls spike CPU and trigger the Garbage Collector too often.
- **NEVER hardcode `get_node("../../Path/To/Node")`** — These paths break as soon as you move a node in the editor. Use **Scene Unique Names** (`%NodeName`) or `@export var target_node: Node` for robust references.
- **NEVER reparent nodes mid-physics-step without care** — Reparenting can cause one-frame transform "teleports". Always store the `global_transform` and re-apply it after the `add_child()` call.
- **NEVER rely on the SceneTree for 10,000+ objects** — If you don't need SceneTree features (signals, per-node scripts), use `PhysicsServer` and `RenderingServer` directly for raw performance.
- **NEVER forget to handle `NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`** — On desktop, if you don't handle the close request in a persistent node, the game may close during a critical save operation.
- **NEVER use deep recursion for node cleanup** — `queue_free()` is natively recursive in Godot 4. Freeing the root node automatically cleans up all children. Manual loops are redundant and inefficient.
- **NEVER mix `SubViewport` and main world inputs without a plan** — By default, input events bubble up. Use `set_input_as_handled()` to prevent UI clicks in a subviewport from triggering gameplay in the main world.
- **NEVER use `change_scene` to "Reset" a level** — It reloads everything from disk. For a quick respawn, just reset the variables and move the player to the start position.

## Decision Tree: How to Change Content

| Goal | Prefer | MANDATORY script |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Full level swap with progress UI | Threaded load → swap when `THREAD_LOAD_LOADED` | [async_scene_manager.gd](../scripts/scene_management_async_scene_manager.gd) |
| Hide hitch before a door/trigger | Start threaded request early during play | [background_resource_loader.gd](../scripts/scene_management_background_resource_loader.gd) |
| Fade / wipe around a swap | Transition Autoload wraps the manager | [scene_transition_manager.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_transition_manager.gd) |
| Keep world; show pause/map/inventory | Additive UI layer (do not `change_scene`) | [additive_ui_layering.gd](../scripts/scene_management_additive_ui_layering.gd) |
| Manual root swap / deferred free | Own current_scene lifecycle | Peer docs + `safe` patterns in `godot-autoload-architecture` |
| Spawn many identical actors | Pool, never raw instantiate/free storms | [scene_pool.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_pool.gd) / [scene_instancing_pooling.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_instancing_pooling.gd) |
| Minimap / split render | `SubViewport` + update mode + input isolation | [subviewport_scene_layering.gd](../scripts/scene_management_subviewport_scene_layering.gd) |
| Survive scene purge | Autoload / persist group — not locals | [persistent_data_preservation.gd](../scripts/scene_management_persistent_data_preservation.gd) / [scene_state_manager.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_state_manager.gd) |
| Quick respawn | Reset state + teleport — **not** `change_scene` | — |
| DLC / hot patch scenes | `ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack` then load path | (PCK) see Official Docs |

## Expert WHY (staging / integrity)

- **Pool pre-fill** during loading screens (`PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED` + hide) — absorb instantiate cost up front via [scene_pool.gd](../scripts/scene_management_scene_pool.gd).
- **Background staging** — `load_threaded_request` mid-gameplay; transition only when loaded ([background_resource_loader.gd](../scripts/scene_management_background_resource_loader.gd)).
- **PCK overrides** — mount pack, then `change_scene`/`load` the same `res://` path for patched content.
- **Orphan audit** — after swaps, `Performance.OBJECT_ORPHAN_NODE_COUNT > 0` means leaked refs still hold freed nodes.
- **Cleanup** — `queue_free()` on a root is recursive in Godot 4; no manual child loops.
- **Quick respawn** — reset state + teleport; **NEVER** `change_scene` just to restart a level.
