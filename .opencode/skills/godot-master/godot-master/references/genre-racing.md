## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Physics & Handling
- NEVER use a rigid camera attachment; strictly use a **Smooth Follow** pattern with `lerp()` to prevent motion sickness.
- NEVER prioritize realism over fun; strictly increase **Gravity Scale** (2x-3x) and keep friction high for responsive arcade feel.
- NEVER use `VehicleBody3D` default settings for karts; strictly rewrite suspension using Raycasts or custom spring/damper models.
- NEVER apply steering torque directly to mass; strictly use a steering curve factored by lateral velocity.
- NEVER calculate suspension without a damper model; strictly include damping to prevent eternal oscillation (bouncing).
- NEVER ignore the **Center of Mass** property; strictly offset it downward to ensure stability during high-speed turns.
- NEVER multiply engine force by `delta`; it is an integrated force in the physics solver.
- NEVER rely on `is_action_pressed()` for manual gear shifting; strictly use `is_action_just_pressed()` for single-tap accuracy.

### AI & Competition
- NEVER use static AI speeds; strictly use **Rubber-Banding** to keep races competitive based on player distance.
- NEVER run AI pathfinding across the entire track every frame; strictly use a "Look-Ahead" point on a spline/path.
- NEVER ignore racing **Checkpoints**; strictly enforce sequential `Area3D` validation to prevent track shortcuts.
- NEVER use standard `Area3D` for slipstreaming without a **Dot Product** check to ensure the player is directly behind.

### Visuals & Audio
- NEVER skip "Sense of Speed" effects; strictly implement dynamic **FOV scaling**, motion blur, and high-speed camera shake.
- NEVER update minimap transforms for static elements in `_process()`; strictly update dynamic racers only.
- NEVER serialize ghost cars as mass transform lists; strictly store positions/quaternions at fixed intervals.
- NEVER use constant pitch for engine sounds; strictly map RPM or engine load to `pitch_scale`.
- NEVER spawn particles for skid marks every frame; strictly use **Trail3D** or procedural strips for low-cost persistence.
- NEVER use standard Strings for surface detection; strictly use `StringName` (e.g., `&"asphalt"`).

## Core Loop
1.  **Race**: Player controls a vehicle on a track.
2.  **Compete**: Player overtakes opponents or beats the clock.
3.  **Upgrade**: Player earns currency/points to buy parts/cars.
4.  **Tune**: Player adjusts vehicle stats (grip, acceleration).
5.  **Master**: Player learns track layouts and optimal lines.

## Related Skills (build order)

Use the **Reference → Related Skills** lattice — do not invent skill ids:

1. **Prerequisites** — [godot-project-foundations](project-foundations.md), [godot-physics-3d](physics-3d.md), [godot-input-handling](input-handling.md)
2. **Complements** — [godot-camera-systems](camera-systems.md), [godot-ai-navigation](ai-navigation.md), [godot-particles](particles.md), [godot-ui-containers](ui-containers.md), [godot-raycasting-queries](raycasting-queries.md)

## Decision Tree — Vehicle Model

| Feel | Choose | **MANDATORY** |
|------|--------|---------------|
| VehicleBody3D arcade (torque / wheel slip) | Built-in wheels + gravity/friction tweaks | [arcade_vehicle_physics.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_arcade_vehicle_physics.gd) |
| Custom suspension / kart crispness | RigidBody3D + RayCast springs | [raycast_vehicle_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_raycast_vehicle_controller.gd) (+ [raycast_suspension.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_raycast_suspension.gd)) |

Do **not** paste a bare `VehicleBody3D` sample — read the chosen script first. Optional input shim: [arcade_vehicle_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_arcade_vehicle_controller.gd).

## Golden Path (script order)

1. **Vehicle** — pick physics script above.
2. **Checkpoints / laps** — [racing_checkpoint.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_racing_checkpoint.gd) → [lap_checkpoint_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_lap_checkpoint_manager.gd) / [lap_tracker.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_lap_tracker.gd).
3. **AI** — [spline_track_spawner.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_spline_track_spawner.gd) → [spline_ai_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_spline_ai_controller.gd).
4. **Ghost** — [ghost_recorder.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_ghost_recorder.gd).

Also wire as needed: [slipstream_handler.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_slipstream_handler.gd), [skid_mark_emitter.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_skid_mark_emitter.gd), [engine_audio_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_engine_audio_controller.gd), [force_feedback_router.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_force_feedback_router.gd), [minimap_icon_projector.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_minimap_icon_projector.gd).

## Floaty Physics / Feel — Fallback Table

| Symptom | Knob | Where |
|---------|------|-------|
| Car floats / weak stick | Raise `gravity_scale` (≈2–3×); Fun > raw realism | [arcade_vehicle_physics.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_arcade_vehicle_physics.gd) |
| Tips / rolls easily | Lower COM (`center_of_mass_mode` + offset) | VehicleBody3D / RigidBody3D |
| Ice-skating lateral slip | Raise `wheel_friction_slip` / `normal_friction_slip`; lower drift slip only while drifting | [arcade_vehicle_physics.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_arcade_vehicle_physics.gd) |
| Raycast kart too bouncy | Tune `spring_stiffness` / `spring_damping` / `tire_grip` | [raycast_vehicle_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_raycast_vehicle_controller.gd), [raycast_suspension.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_raycast_suspension.gd) |
| Bad / rigid camera | `Marker3D` + lerp follow; never hard-parent to chassis | [godot-camera-systems](camera-systems.md) |
| Tunnel vision / no speed read | Scale FOV with speed; optional shake, wind lines, motion blur | Camera3D + Environment; FOV tween on boost |

## Advanced Racing Meta-Systems

Do **not** paste inline DriftBoost/Ghost samples — extend the scripts:

1. **Drift-Boost / Mini-Turbo** — **MANDATORY**: use drift hooks in [arcade_vehicle_physics.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_arcade_vehicle_physics.gd) (`is_drifting`, `drift_friction_slip`); charge + `apply_central_impulse` on release; brief Camera FOV tween for boost feel.
2. **Tire-Smoke / skids** — **MANDATORY**: [skid_mark_emitter.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_skid_mark_emitter.gd) gated by `get_skidinfo()`; pair with [godot-particles](particles.md) — never spawn particles every physics frame.
3. **Replay-Ghost binary** — **MANDATORY**: [ghost_recorder.gd](../scripts/genre_racing_ghost_recorder.gd) for transform serialization; persist via [godot-save-load-systems](save-load-systems.md).

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [racing-systems-deep.md](genre-racing-racing-systems-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **VehicleBody3D**: Godot's built-in node for vehicle physics. It's decent for arcade, but for sims, you might want a custom RayCast suspension.
*   **Path3D / PathFollow3D**: Excellent for simple AI traffic or fixed-path racers (on-rails).
*   **AudioBus**: Use the `Doppler` effect on the AudioListener for realistic passing sounds.
*   **SubViewport**: Use for the rear-view mirror or minimap texture.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **Floaty Physics**: Cars feel like they are on ice. **Fix**: Increase gravity scale (2x-3x) and adjust wheel friction. Realism < Fun.
2.  **Bad Camera**: Camera is rigidly attached to the car. **Fix**: Use a `Marker3D` with a `lerp` script to follow the car smoothly with a slight delay.
3.  **Tunnel Vision**: No sense of speed. **Fix**: Increase FOV as speed increases, add camera shake, wind lines, and motion blur.
