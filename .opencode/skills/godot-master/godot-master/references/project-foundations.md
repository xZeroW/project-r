# Project Foundations

Feature-based organization, consistent naming, and version control hygiene define professional Godot projects.

## Available Scripts

### Core Scaffolding (Stateful / Persistent)
- **[project_bootstrapper.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_project_bootstrapper.gd)**: Auto-generates feature folders and .gitignore.
- **[runtime_configurator.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_runtime_configurator.gd)**: Applies high-performance profiles and saves `override.cfg`.
- **[managed_autoload.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_managed_autoload.gd)**: Advanced Singleton pattern with `RefCounted` delegation.
- **[global_event_bus.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_global_event_bus.gd)**: **MANDATORY** for decoupled global signals — do not re-inline EventBus samples in chat.
- **[node_pooling_system.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_node_pooling_system.gd)**: Thread-safe Object Pool for high-frequency scene instantiation.
- **[async_resource_loader.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_async_resource_loader.gd)**: **MANDATORY** for threaded scene transitions — do not re-inline SceneManager samples.

### Runtime Utilities (Stateless / Lightweight)
- **[base_data_resource.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_base_data_resource.gd)**: Reactive Resource foundation using `emit_changed()`.
- **[advanced_telemetry_logger.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_advanced_telemetry_logger.gd)**: Custom OS-level `Logger` for crash reporting.
- **[threaded_task_worker.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_threaded_task_worker.gd)**: Robust `WorkerThreadPool` implementation.
- **[action_buffer_input.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_action_buffer_input.gd)**: Foundational `_unhandled_input` buffer.
- **[build_metadata_provider.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_build_metadata_provider.gd)**: Native extraction of version and build metadata.
- **[feature_scaffolder.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_feature_scaffolder.gd)** / **[scene_naming_validator.gd](../scripts/project_foundations_scene_naming_validator.gd)**: Feature folder + naming gates.

> **Do NOT Load** `dependency_auditor.gd` unless troubleshooting loading errors.

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Global Architecture
- **NEVER group by file type** — `/scripts`, `/sprites` folders. Nightmare maintainability. Use feature-based: `/player`, `/ui`.
- **NEVER mix snake_case and PascalCase in files** — Standard: snake_case for files, PascalCase for nodes.
- **NEVER use hardcoded get_node() paths** — Brittle on reparenting. Use `%SceneUniqueNames` for stable references.
- **NEVER use monolithic Autoloads** — Avoid managers that hold visual node references; keep singletons focused on pure data or RefCounted delegation.

### Resource Management
- **NEVER forget .gitignore** — Committing `.godot/` folder = 100MB+ bloat + conflicts.
- **NEVER skip .gdignore for raw assets** — Design source files (`.psd`, `.blend`) in root will be imported unless ignored.
- **NEVER modify globally shared Resources directly** — Strictly call `duplicate(true)` for unique instances with independent state.

### Performance & Threading
- **NEVER block the main thread with `load()`** — Strictly use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` for async scene transitions.
- **NEVER modify the SceneTree from a background thread** — Strictly use `call_deferred()` for thread-to-main-thread synchronization.
- **NEVER skip Mutex locking during pooled access** — Strictly ensure thread-safety when using a shared `WorkerThreadPool` or Object Pool.
- **NEVER use `_process()` for precise input** — Tied to visual framerate. Strictly use `_unhandled_input()` to capture exact, frame-independent events.

## Ownership decision tree

| Need | Prefer | Avoid |
|------|--------|-------|
| Everything for one feature (player, HUD panel) | **Feature folder** scene module | Type folders (`/scripts`, `/sprites`) |
| Cross-scene service with lifecycle (save, audio bus) | **Autoload** via `managed_autoload.gd` | Stuffing UI nodes into singletons |
| Many publishers/subscribers, no ownership | **EventBus** → **MANDATORY** `global_event_bus.gd` | Autoload that imports half the game |
| One scene's private wiring | **Scene-local node** + `%UniqueName` | Global bus for parent→child calls |

---

### 1. Naming Conventions
- **Files & Folders**: `snake_case` (C# exception: PascalCase class-match).
- **Node Names**: `PascalCase`.
- **Exports**: `snake_case`; Inspector Title-Cases them.
- **Private**: leading `_` on members and virtuals (`_ready`, `_process`).
- **Signals**: past-tense `snake_case` (`health_changed`).
- **Unique Names**: `%SceneUniqueNames` over brittle `get_node()` paths.

### 2. Feature-Based Organization
Group by feature (`/entities/player`, `/ui/main_menu`), not by file type. Keep `/common`, `/levels`, `/addons`.

### 3. Version Control
Godot-aware `.gitignore` (ignore `.godot/`) + `.gdignore` on raw design sources.

## Workflow: Scaffolding a New Project

1. Ensure `project.godot` exists → run `project_bootstrapper.gd` / create `entities/`, `ui/`, `levels/`, `common/`.
2. Setup Git `.gitignore` + document feature-based layout in `README.md`.
3. Register lean Autoloads only after the ownership decision tree says so.

## Typed GDScript strictness (foundations-only)

Full typed-GDScript migration lives in [godot-gdscript-mastery](gdscript-mastery.md).
For new foundations projects: **Project Settings → Debug → GDScript → Untyped Declaration** = `Warn` or `Error`.

## Expert Foundation Architectures

### Scene transitions
**MANDATORY** load [`async_resource_loader.gd`](../scripts/project_foundations_async_resource_loader.gd) — threaded `ResourceLoader` with progress. Do not paste SceneManager samples here.

### Global Event Bus
**MANDATORY** load [`global_event_bus.gd`](../scripts/project_foundations_global_event_bus.gd) for typed global signals. Do not paste EventBus samples here.

### Project Metadata
Use [`build_metadata_provider.gd`](../scripts/project_foundations_build_metadata_provider.gd) / [`base_data_resource.gd`](../scripts/project_foundations_base_data_resource.gd) for version/build flags instead of ad-hoc JSON.
