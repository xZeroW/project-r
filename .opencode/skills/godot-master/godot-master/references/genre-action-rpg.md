## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Combat & Progression
- NEVER use linear damage scaling for progression; strictly use an **exponential curve** (e.g., `base * pow(1.15, level)`) to maintain the power fantasy.
- NEVER allow defense stats to stack linearly to 100%; strictly use a **Diminishing Returns** formula (e.g., `armor / (armor + 100.0)`) to prevent invincibility.
- NEVER skip Hit Recovery (Stagger); strictly implement a brief stagger state (0.2s - 0.5s) on significant hits to prevent "floaty" combat.
- NEVER hide critical stats from the player; strictly provide a detailed character sheet for theory-crafting (Crit Chance, Resistance, etc.).
- NEVER make loot drops visually identical; strictly differentiate rarities with color-coded beams (purple/gold) and distinct sound cues.
- NEVER calculate hitboxes, knockbacks, or combat movement in `_process()`; strictly use `_physics_process()` for deterministic results.
- NEVER evaluate exact floating-point equality (==) for combat thresholds; strictly use `is_equal_approx()`.
- NEVER use the ! (NOT) operator in AnimationTree Advance Condition expressions; strictly use explicit boolean equality (`is_walking == false`).

### Technical & Architecture
- NEVER store character stats or massive inventories as Nodes; strictly use **Resource-based data containers** for lightweight memory overhead.
- NEVER forget to call `duplicate()` on shared Resources; modifying one goblin's stats must not affect all other instances.
- NEVER rigidly couple combat detection to specific classes; strictly use **Duck-Typing** (e.g., `if body.has_method(&"take_damage")`) for interaction.
- NEVER rely on the UI SceneTree as the source of truth for inventory; strictly separate data logic from visualization.
- NEVER recalculate stats every frame; strictly trigger recalculation only on gear changes or level-ups.
- NEVER parse massive RPG save files synchronously; strictly offload heavy parsing to the `WorkerThreadPool`.
- NEVER synchronize complex Resource types over the network; strictly serialize changes into primitive Dictionaries or PackedByteArrays.
- NEVER manage character state by coupling child nodes to parent existence; strictly use signals for loose coupling ("Signal Up, Call Down").
- NEVER use standard Strings for high-frequency AI state identifiers; strictly use `StringName` for optimized hash comparisons.

### Performance & AI
- NEVER instantiate/destroy hundreds of objects (projectiles, damage text) per second; strictly use **Object Pooling**.
- NEVER delete active combat entities via `free()`; strictly use `queue_free()` for safe deferred disposal.
- NEVER calculate complex loot drops or parse massive late-game inventories on the main thread; strictly offload heavy RNG rolls and array iterations to the **WorkerThreadPool**.
- NEVER use nested if/elif blocks for complex Boss AI; strictly use a modular **StateMachine** or pattern matching.
- NEVER iterate through the SceneTree for global state changes; strictly use **Signal Groups** (`call_group()`).
- NEVER move `OccluderInstance3D` nodes attached to dynamic characters; this causes CPU BVH rebuild stalls.

## Core Loop

`Combat → Loot → Level Up → Build Power → Challenge Harder Content → Repeat`

## Skill Chain

`godot-project-foundations` → `godot-characterbody-2d` → `godot-combat-system` → `godot-rpg-stats` → `godot-inventory-system` → `godot-ability-system` → `godot-quest-system` → `godot-economy-system` → `godot-save-load-systems` → `godot-monte-carlo-balancer`

## Decision Trees (no class dumps)

| Problem | Decision | Script / peer |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Melee / projectile contact | Area hitbox frames in `_physics_process` | hitbox_component + duck_typed_hitbox |
| Armor stacking feels broken | Diminishing returns, not linear % | stat_reduction_solver |
| Damage numbers hitch | Pool labels | damage_label_manager |
| Shared goblin HP mutates all | Deep duplicate Resources at instance | deep/entity_stat_duplicator |
| Boss nested if/elif | Hierarchical FSM + telegraphs | hierarchical_state_base + telegraphed_enemy |
| AoE costs too much | PhysicsServer queries / groups | aoe_physics_query / aoe_group_broadcaster |
| Late-game bag parse hitch | WorkerThreadPool | threaded_inventory_loader |
| AnimationTree flip flops | Explicit bool Advance Conditions | animation_condition_sync |
| Full loot affix / bag UI | Do NOT re-teach here | godot-inventory-system |
| Hotbar abilities / mana | Do NOT re-teach here | godot-ability-system |
| Modifier stacks / curves | Do NOT re-teach here | godot-rpg-stats |

### Architecture Overview (composition)
Prefer Health/Hitbox child components (godot-composition) over `BaseEnemy` inheritance. UI observes signals; inventory Resources are truth — never the HUD tree.

### Common Pitfalls (short)
- Floaty combat → add hit recovery/stagger.
- Identical loot → rarity beams + SFX (RenderingServer per-instance params OK).
- Frame-rate combat → `_physics_process` only for hit resolve.

> **MANDATORY** for combat/loot/equipment/area-scaling depth beyond decision trees: [arpg-subsystems-deep.md](genre-action-rpg-arpg-subsystems-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** for first-pass hitbox + stats wiring — use scripts above.

## Advanced ARPG Meta-Systems

### 1. Paragon / Infinite Scaling Resource
Keep post-cap power in a duplicated Resource; emit `emit_changed()` on level; never mutate the cached template.

### 2. Shader-Based Loot Beams
Pass rarity color via `RenderingServer.instance_geometry_set_shader_parameter` on a shared shader — avoid material `duplicate()` storms.

### 3. Stat-Snapshot Combat Logging
Buffer Dictionary snapshots; flush periodically to `user://` (never `res://`).

### Official Documentation
- [Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html) — ARPG stats, loot affixes, leveling tables, and equipment templates belong in `Resource` assets so designers can author `.tres` data without rewriting combat code.
- [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html) — Always `duplicate(true)` shared stat/loot templates at spawn so one goblin’s HP or inventory mutation cannot rewrite every instance’s `.tres`.
- [GDScript exports](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.html) — `@export` / typed Dictionaries drive Inspector-tuned damage, resistances, XP curves, and gear slots that balance without recompiling scripts.
- [Using Area2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/using_area_2d.html) — Hitbox/hurtbox overlap signals are the engine baseline for real-time melee and projectile contact detection.
- [Ray-casting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/ray-casting.html) — Direct space-state shape/ray queries power high-entity-count AoE and line checks without spawning a Node per blast.
- [Idle and Physics Processing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/idle_and_physics_processing.html) — Resolve hitboxes, knockback, telegraphs, and chase ticks in `_physics_process` for fixed-delta combat determinism.
- [Using signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html) — Combat logs, XP grants, boss phases, and HUD damage floats should subscribe to signals instead of hard-referencing fighters.
- [Groups](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/groups.html) — Faction aggro and AoE damage should `call_group` / `call_group_flags` rather than walking the SceneTree every frame.
- [Scene organization](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/scene_organization.html) — Keep “signals up, calls down”: parents/UI observe combat; managers call into hitboxes and state nodes—never treat the HUD as inventory truth.
- [Using AnimationTree](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.html) — Sync attack/move Advance Conditions with explicit booleans (no `!` in expressions) so combo and stagger states stay reliable.
- [WorkerThreadPool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_workerthreadpool.html) — Parse large late-game inventories, loot rolls, and save blobs off the main thread so combat stays at 60 FPS.
- [Saving games](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/saving_games.html) — Persist level, gear, skill ranks, and cooldown end timestamps with the rest of progression—never write runtime logs to `res://`.
