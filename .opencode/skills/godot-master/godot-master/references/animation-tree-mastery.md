# AnimationTree Mastery

Expert guidance for Godot's advanced animation blending and state machines.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER call `play()` on AnimationPlayer when using AnimationTree** — AnimationTree controls the player. Directly calling `play()` causes conflicts and jitter. Use `set("parameters/transition_request")` or `travel()` instead.
- **NEVER forget to set `active = true`** — AnimationTree is inactive by default. Animations won't play until `$AnimationTree.active = true`.
- **NEVER use absolute paths for parameter access** — Use relative paths like `"parameters/StateMachine/transition_request"`. This ensures compatibility when nodes move in the hierarchy.
- **NEVER leave `auto_advance` enabled for interactive states** — It causes immediate transitions. Use it only for automated sequences like combo chains or death-to-respawn.
- **NEVER use `BlendSpace2D` for 1D blending** — Blending only speed? Use `BlendSpace1D`. Blending only two states? Use `Blend2`. `BlendSpace2D` is specifically for X+Y directional inputs (strafe).
- **NEVER update `AnimationTree` parameters every frame without a guard** — Setting parameters via `set()` every frame regardless of change causes cache invalidation and potential stutter. Check equality first.
- **NEVER use deep, nested `BlendTrees` for simple logic** — Every layer adds CPU overhead. If logic can be handled in a `StateMachine` or a simple script-driven `Blend2`, do it there.
- **NEVER forget to handle `await get_tree().process_frame` when updating parameters synchronously** — Sometimes the tree needs one frame to reconcile state before the next parameter change takes effect.
- **NEVER rely on `auto_advance` for long cutscenes** — If an animation is interrupted, `auto_advance` can put the character in a broken state. Use `Method Tracks` to signal state completion instead.
- **NEVER use `Sync` groups for animations with wildly different lengths** — It forces one animation to play at an extreme speed. Use `TimeScale` or separate layers for mismatching cycles.

**Core Concepts (compact):** AnimationTree owns an AnimationPlayer via `anim_player`; root is StateMachine / BlendTree / BlendSpace; parameters use relative `"parameters/..." ` paths; set `active = true` once in `_ready`.

```gdscript
@onready var anim_tree: AnimationTree = $AnimationTree
@onready var playback: AnimationNodeStateMachinePlayback = anim_tree.get("parameters/StateMachine/playback")

func _ready() -> void:
    anim_tree.active = true
```

Do not paste full StateMachine/BlendSpace editor walkthroughs — author graphs in the AnimationTree editor, then drive them with the scripts above.

## Expert insights (WHY — keep in body)

- **Advance conditions vs travel** — WHY: bool conditions auto-fire transitions; `travel()` is explicit pathing. Use conditions for damage/death events; travel for locomotion intent.
- **BlendSpace2D cost** — WHY: 8-way blending samples multiple clips. Use BlendSpace1D for speed-only; Blend2 for two-state crossfades.
- **Parameter guard** — WHY: redundant `set()` invalidates tree cache every frame. Route writes through [sync_parameter_manager.gd](../scripts/animation_tree_mastery_sync_parameter_manager.gd).
- **Method tracks** — WHY: gameplay should listen to dispatcher signals, not parse animation names. See [animation_event_dispatcher.gd](../scripts/animation_tree_mastery_animation_event_dispatcher.gd).
