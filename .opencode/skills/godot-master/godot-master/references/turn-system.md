Covers speed-based initiative, interrupts, and simultaneous turns. Use when implementing turn-based combat OR tactical systems.

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Order & Determinism
- NEVER recalculate turn order every action; strictly sort once per round or ONLY when a speed-relevant stat changes to prevent O(n log n) lag.
- NEVER use random tie-breaking for initiative; strictly use a secondary static attribute (Agility, ID, or persistent "luck") for **deterministic replays**.
- NEVER modify an active turn-order queue while iterating it; strictly iterate over a `duplicate()` or apply queue modifications after the loop.
- NEVER broadcast global turn state changes using immediate `call_group()`; strictly use **`call_group_flags(SceneTree.GROUP_CALL_DEFERRED, ...)`** to prevent frame spikes when notifying hundreds of units.
 
- NEVER rely on the Node hierarchy as the source of truth; strictly use a **Dictionary board state** for logical grid coordinates.

### Logic & Action Economy
- NEVER deduct Action Points (AP) before validation; strictly call `can_perform_action(cost)` before applying `current_ap -= cost` to prevent exploits.
- NEVER hardcode phase transitions (`if phase == 0`); strictly use an **enum + match** or a dedicated State Machine for Draw/Main/End phases.
- NEVER emit "Turn Ended" before internal cleanup; strictly reset AP and tick status effects **BEFORE** signaling the next turn.
- NEVER use exact floating-point equality (`==`) for AP checks; strictly use `>=` or `is_equal_approx()` for robust comparisons.

### Tactical Grid & UI
- NEVER use generic `AStar2D` for tile grids; strictly use **`AStarGrid2D`** for 10x faster pathfinding and native diagonal handling.
- NEVER forget to call **`update()`** on `AStarGrid2D` after changing obstacle states; if you toggle `set_point_solid()`, the grid MUST refresh before the next query.
- NEVER lock the main thread with `while` loops for input; strictly use the **await keyword** or signals to yield execution back to the Tree.
- NEVER handle turn decisions with `is_action_pressed()`; strictly use `is_action_just_pressed()` for discrete, frame-locked menu input.
- NEVER skip turn timeouts in networked games; strictly implement a **server-side timer** with a default "pass" action to prevent griefing. See **Networked Turn Timeout** golden path below.

## Decision Tree — Pick a Turn Model

| Need | Choose | **MANDATORY** script |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Discrete rounds (chess / tactics / card phases) | Round + initiative queue + AP phases | [turn_system_patterns.gd](../scripts/turn_system_turn_system_patterns.gd) |
| Continuous gauges (FF-style ATB) | Per-actor gauge fill in `_process` | [active_time_battle.gd](../scripts/turn_system_active_time_battle.gd) |
| Timeline / CTB with interrupts & prediction | Event timeline + predictive UI | [timeline_turn_manager.gd](../scripts/turn_system_timeline_turn_manager.gd) |

> **Do NOT** invent a fourth model inline. Read the matching script before coding.

## Expert Components (scripts/)

- [turn_system_patterns.gd](../scripts/turn_system_turn_system_patterns.gd) — Match-based phase machines, UndoRedo, `AStarGrid2D` board helpers.
- [active_time_battle.gd](../scripts/turn_system_active_time_battle.gd) — ATB gauges, pause-on-ready, async action handoff.
- [timeline_turn_manager.gd](../scripts/turn_system_timeline_turn_manager.gd) — Timeline / CTB with interrupts and pre-visualization.
- [turn_predictor.gd](../scripts/turn_system_turn_predictor.gd) — Simulate ATB gauges for timeline UI preview.
- [combat_stats_resource.gd](../scripts/turn_system_combat_stats_resource.gd) — Deterministic damage preview Resource for hover UI.

## TurnManager Autoload — Interface Contract Only

Keep the Autoload thin. **Do not** paste full queue math here — implement in the script chosen above.

```gdscript
# turn_manager.gd (AutoLoad) — contract only
extends Node
signal turn_started(combatant: Node)
signal turn_ended(combatant: Node)
signal round_ended
signal turn_timed_out(combatant: Node)  # multiplayer: server default-pass

func start_combat(participants: Array[Node]) -> void: pass
func end_turn() -> void: pass
func request_pass(combatant: Node) -> void: pass  # default action on timeout
```

## Networked Turn Timeout (Golden Path)

Referenced from NEVER: server owns the clock; clients never decide "pass."

1. On `turn_started`, server starts a one-shot `Timer` / `SceneTreeTimer` (authoritative).
2. On timeout: server calls `request_pass(current)` (or auto-end-turn), then emits `turn_timed_out`.
3. Clients only render the countdown; never mutate the turn queue locally.
4. Pair with [godot-multiplayer-networking](multiplayer-networking.md) for host-auth RPC.

## Action Points (Contract)

```gdscript
func can_perform_action(cost: int) -> bool:
    return current_action_points >= cost

func perform_action(cost: int) -> bool:
    if not can_perform_action(cost):
        return false
    current_action_points -= cost
    return true
```

Phases: prefer `enum Phase { DRAW, MAIN, END }` + `match`, or route to [godot-state-machine-advanced](state-machine-advanced.md). Full ATB / timeline math lives in the MANDATORY scripts — do not duplicate Elite snippets here.

## Deep recipes (on demand)

> LLM-ignorance rule: if a general agent would not know it before reading, it lives here or in `scripts/` — never delete, only move.
