## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Audio Sync & Logic
- NEVER use `Time.get_ticks_msec()` / `Time.get_ticks_usec()` as the song clock; strictly use **`AudioStreamPlayer.get_playback_position() + AudioServer.get_time_since_last_mix() - AudioServer.get_output_latency()`** (see [rhythm_conductor.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_conductor.gd)).
- NEVER process song logic in `_process()`; strictly use **`_physics_process()`** or a conductor loop to ensure deterministic timing regardless of render frames.
- NEVER use `_process()` to capture hit inputs; strictly use **`_input(event)`** to record the exact timestamp of the button press event.
- NEVER scale engine time_scale for song speed; strictly use **`AudioStreamPlayer.pitch_scale`** to adjust speed and avoid globally breaking physics logic.
- NEVER neglect **Audio Latency** calibration; strictly provide a tool for players to adjust for hardware/Bluetooth delays (~30-100ms) to prevent "unplayable" sync issues.
- NEVER use `_process` delta as the song clock; strictly read the conductor's `get_song_time()` (playback + mix − output latency).
- NEVER move thousands of note sprites on the CPU; strictly use a **Shader-Based Highway** (UV scrolling) to offload track movement to the GPU.
- NEVER use `yield` or `await` for beat timing; strictly use a sample-accurate **Delta Accumulator** tied to the audio clock.
- NEVER assume a constant BPM; strictly build your conductor to handle a **Tempo Map** for complex track changes.

### Feedback & Performance
- NEVER judge inputs based on world position (pixels); strictly judge against the **Song's Elapsed Time (ms)** to ensure consistency across resolutions.
- NEVER play hit sounds with static pitch; strictly add **±5% Random Pitch Variation** to hit sounds to avoid the "machine gun" effect.
- NEVER use tight timing windows (e.g., <25ms) for all players; strictly use **Wider Windows for Beginners** to prevent immediate frustration.
- NEVER instantiate note nodes every beat; strictly use **Object Pooling** to recycle note instances and prevent GC spikes during dense tracks.
- NEVER use standard Area2D signals for rhythmic hits; strictly **Poll Inputs** in the conductor loop to compare against target timestamps.
- NEVER calculate FFT for visualization on the main thread; strictly use **AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzerInstance** for optimized engine-side analysis.
- NEVER allow note spamming/mashing; strictly penalize misses or break combos to maintain the game's integrity.
- NEVER use `load()` dynamically during gameplay; strictly use **ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()** to avoid thread stalling.
- NEVER forget to pause the conductor/ highway; strictly sync with the audio player's pause state to prevent notes from scrolling while the music is stopped.

## 🛠 Expert Components (scripts/)

> **MANDATORY reads** before implementing the matching system:
> 1. [rhythm_conductor.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_conductor.gd) — canonical audio clock
> 2. [input_judge_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_input_judge_logic.gd) — time-window judging

> 4. [latency_calibrator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_latency_calibrator.gd) — player hardware offset

### Original Expert Patterns
- [rhythm_conductor.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_conductor.gd) - Song time = playback_position + mix − output latency.
- [input_judge_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_input_judge_logic.gd) - ms windows vs song time (not pixel position).
- [note_object_pool.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_object_pool.gd) - Recycle note instances under dense charts.
- [latency_calibrator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_latency_calibrator.gd) - Calibration UI offset applied on the conductor.

### Modular Components
- [note_orchestrator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_orchestrator.gd) - Spawn/schedule notes from chart data.
- [rhythm_scoring_system.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_scoring_system.gd) - Score aggregation from judgments.
- [score_combo_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_score_combo_manager.gd) - Combo / break rules.
- [rhythm_ui_feedback.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_ui_feedback.gd) - Hit sparks / judgment labels.
- [beat_synced_animator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_beat_synced_animator.gd) - Visuals locked to conductor beats.
- [note_lane_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_lane_manager.gd) - Multi-lane layout helpers.
- [dynamic_bpm_handler.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_dynamic_bpm_handler.gd) - Tempo map / BPM changes.
- [audio_spectrum_analyzer.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_audio_spectrum_analyzer.gd) - Spectrum visuals (not the clock).

> **Do NOT load** unused lanes: skip [audio_spectrum_analyzer.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_audio_spectrum_analyzer.gd) unless building reactive viz; skip [dynamic_bpm_handler.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_dynamic_bpm_handler.gd) for constant-BPM tracks.

> **Script map:** Baseline `MusicConductor` samples → [rhythm_conductor.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_conductor.gd); `JudgmentSystem` → [input_judge_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_input_judge_logic.gd); chart spawn → [note_orchestrator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_orchestrator.gd) + [note_object_pool.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_object_pool.gd).

## Core Loop
1. **Calibrate latency** → 2. **Conductor clock** → 3. **Spawn pooled notes** → 4. **`_input` judge** → 5. **Score/combo UI**

## Decision Trees

### Clock (one recipe)
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Song position | **MANDATORY** [rhythm_conductor.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_conductor.gd) `get_song_time()` |
| Visual highway | Position from song time / beats — never `_process` delta integration as truth |
| Hit timestamp | Capture in `_input` / `_unhandled_input`, compare to note target time |

### Systems
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Judgment windows | [input_judge_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_input_judge_logic.gd) |
| Scoring / combo | [rhythm_scoring_system.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_scoring_system.gd) + [score_combo_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_score_combo_manager.gd) |
| Chart spawn | [note_orchestrator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_orchestrator.gd) + pool |
| Juice | [rhythm_ui_feedback.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_rhythm_ui_feedback.gd) / [beat_synced_animator.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_beat_synced_animator.gd) |

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Audio | `godot-audio-systems` | Stream clock + latency |
| 2. Input | `godot-input-handling` | Timestamped hits |
| 3. UI | `godot-ui-containers` | Highway / HUD |
| 4. Perf | pooling / shaders | Dense charts |
| 5. Balance | `godot-monte-carlo-balancer` | Window difficulty bands |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `Time.get_ticks_*` conductor | Use playback + mix − latency |
| Judge in `_process` | `_input` + song time |
| Instantiate per note | [note_object_pool.gd](../scripts/genre_rhythm_note_object_pool.gd) |

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [rhythm-systems-deep.md](genre-rhythm-rhythm-systems-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Godot-Specific Tips

1. **Audio latency**: Calibrate with `AudioServer` and custom offset
2. **Input polling**: Use `_input` not `_process` for precise timing
3. **Shaders**: UV scrolling for note highways
4. **Particles**: Use `GPUParticles2D` for hit effects

### 3. Hardware-Synced Latency Calibration
Calculate precise offsets by compensating for OS/Hardware latency.
