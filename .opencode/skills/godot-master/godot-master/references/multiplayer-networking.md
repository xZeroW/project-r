## NEVER Do (Expert Networking Rules)

### Core Architecture
- **NEVER use `Reliable` for high-frequency data (Position/Movement)** — Reliable packets block all following packets until acknowledged (Head-of-Line blocking). Use `UnreliableOrdered`.
- **NEVER trust the client for shared state (Health/Money/Inventory)** — Clients should only suggest actions. The Server MUST validate and broadcast the result.
- **NEVER hardcode the Server IP** — Always allow for discovery (`net_lan_discovery.gd`) or pass the IP via CLI/UI.

### Performance & Bandwidth
- **NEVER send the same data every frame** — Use `net_adaptive_sync_throttle.gd` to only send updates when state changes significantly or at fixed Hz intervals (e.g., 20Hz).
- **NEVER use `JSON` for high-speed synchronization** — String serialization is massive over the wire. Use bit-packing (`net_packet_bit_packer.gd`) to keep packets under 100 bytes.
- **NEVER broadcast to all peers if it's not needed** — In large worlds, use Interest Management (`net_visibility_grid_culling.gd`). A player in the forest doesn't need the position of a player in the city.

### Security
- **NEVER allow unlimited RPC calls per second** — An attacker can flood the server with 1,000 "Attack" RPCs to crash the game. Use `net_packet_rate_limiter.gd`.
- **NEVER expose PeerIDs to the end-user** — PeerIDs are internal. Always map them to persistent `UserIDs` (`net_custom_id_mapper.gd`) from a database.
- **NEVER run a dedicated server with a GUI enabled** — Use `--headless` (`net_headless_server_auto_start.gd`) to save resources and ensure stability.

## Decision Tree (transport / authority / sync Hz)

| Question | Prefer | Script |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Desktop/console LAN or dedicated UDP | ENet | **MANDATORY** [net_enet_expert_config.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_enet_expert_config.gd) |
| Browser / NAT-hostile peers | WebRTC (or WebSocket fallback) | Official Docs + peer wrappers; still use secure RPC scripts |
| Who owns gameplay truth? | Server-authoritative | **MANDATORY** [server_authoritative_controller.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_server_authoritative_controller.gd) |
| Dedicated host without GUI | `--headless` | **MANDATORY** [net_headless_server_auto_start.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_headless_server_auto_start.gd) / [server_dedicated_host.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_server_dedicated_host.gd) |
| Position @ 10–20 Hz, not every frame | Adaptive throttle | **MANDATORY** [net_adaptive_sync_throttle.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_adaptive_sync_throttle.gd) |

> **Do NOT Load** lobby/RPC beginner recipes from memory — use the golden path below and open only matching scripts.

## Golden Path

1. **Host / dedicated** → [server_dedicated_host.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_server_dedicated_host.gd) + [net_headless_server_auto_start.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_headless_server_auto_start.gd); clients → [client_network_setup.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_client_network_setup.gd).
2. **Secure RPC** → [secured_rpc_pattern.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_secured_rpc_pattern.gd) + [net_packet_rate_limiter.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_packet_rate_limiter.gd) + [secure_variable_synchronizer.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_secure_variable_synchronizer.gd).
3. **Prediction / reconcile** → [client_prediction_synchronizer.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_client_prediction_synchronizer.gd) + [net_anti_desync_reconciler.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_anti_desync_reconciler.gd); fighting/rollback → [net_rollback_helper.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_rollback_helper.gd).
4. **Interest culling** → [net_visibility_grid_culling.gd](../scripts/multiplayer_networking_net_visibility_grid_culling.gd) before broadcasting positions.

## Expert Pointers

- Position/movement: `UnreliableOrdered` + throttle — never reliable every frame.
- Clients suggest; server validates and broadcasts results.
- Large worlds: cull with visibility grid before adding more sync Hz.

## Deep dives (on demand)

- RPC modes, lobby handshake, puppet interpolation → [rpc-lobby-and-sync.md](multiplayer-networking-rpc-lobby-and-sync.md)
- Delta-compression + network simulator concepts live in that reference (LLM-ignorance: unreliable vs reliable HoL blocking is NOT generic knowledge).
