description: "Expert blueprint for TPS/hybrid shooters: soft-lock aim assist, cover validation rays, SpringArm TPS camera, and genre routing to FPS sibling for viewmodel/hitscan feel. Use for third-person/cover shooters and hybrids. Keywords: TPS, soft_lock, cover, SpringArm3D, hybrid shooter, aim assist — not FPS-only movement."

## Core Loop

`Engage → Aim (soft-lock/cover) → Fire → Confirm → Acquire Next`

## NEVER Do (TPS / hybrid)

- **NEVER put FPS viewmodel/bob/look recipes in this skill** — route to shooter-fps.
- **NEVER use `_process()` for hit registration** — `_physics_process` + space-state queries.
- **NEVER trust the client for authoritative hits** — server validate / rewind.
- **NEVER use Area3D overlap for bullets** — ray / shape queries.
- **NEVER hardcode weapon stats in logic** — `WeaponData` Resources.
- **NEVER skip excluding the shooter's RID** on queries.
- **NEVER use TCP for shooter net sync** — ENet/UDP.

## MANDATORY scripts (non-FPS paths)

> Read before implementing the matching system:

1. [soft_lock_aim_assist.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_soft_lock_aim_assist.gd) — controller/hybrid assist & sticky aim  
2. [cover_validator_rays.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_cover_validator_rays.gd) — cover / peek validity rays  
3. [tps_camera_spring_arm.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_tps_camera_spring_arm.gd) — SpringArm3D TPS camera collision  

Also available: [advanced_weapon_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_advanced_weapon_controller.gd) (shared weapon controller — prefer FPS skill for FPS feel), [shooter_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_shooter_patterns.gd), [projectile.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_projectile.gd), [weapon_recoil_pattern.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_weapon_recoil_pattern.gd) (spray Resource), [lag_compensator.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_lag_compensator.gd) (server rewind).

## Decision trees

### Camera / stance
| Need | Action |
|---|---|
| Over-shoulder TPS | [tps_camera_spring_arm.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_tps_camera_spring_arm.gd) |
| Cover check before peek-fire | [cover_validator_rays.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_cover_validator_rays.gd) |
| Soft-lock / assist | [soft_lock_aim_assist.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_soft_lock_aim_assist.gd) |
| True FPS digsite | → [godot-genre-shooter-fps](genre-shooter-fps.md) |

### Fire mode
| Need | Action |
|---|---|
| Hitscan / projectile theory | Shared WeaponData + space-state; FPS implementation details in shooter-fps |
| Pooled projectiles | [projectile.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_projectile.gd) / patterns script |
| Explosion radius | ShapeCast3D pattern in [shooter_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_shooter_patterns.gd) |

### Net
| Need | Action |
|---|---|
| Client juice | Predict tracers locally |
| Damage | Server authoritative; show no-reg on mismatch |
| Net rewind / lag comp | [lag_compensator.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_lag_compensator.gd) + [advanced-meta-systems.md](genre-shooter-advanced-meta-systems.md) |
| Learnable spray | [weapon_recoil_pattern.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_weapon_recoil_pattern.gd) |

## Weapon selection (short)

Hitscan for rifles/SMGs; physical projectiles for rockets/arrows; balance in **`WeaponData` Resources** (`.tres`), never hardcoded on nodes.

| Archetype | ROF | Damage | Implementation |
|-----------|-----|--------|----------------|
| SMG | High | Low | Hitscan + tight vertical spray |
| Sniper | Low | High | Hitscan + tracer |
| Shotgun | Burst | Medium | Multi-pellet spread, <10m |
| Rocket | Slow | High | [projectile.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_projectile.gd) + shape AoE |

Gunplay theory → [tps-gunplay-core.md](genre-shooter-tps-gunplay-core.md). Net rewind → [advanced-meta-systems.md](genre-shooter-advanced-meta-systems.md).

## Recoil and feel (WHY)

Apply kick to **camera rotation** and **spread bloom**, not weapon mesh alone. Learnable spray via [weapon_recoil_pattern.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_weapon_recoil_pattern.gd). Layer gunfire: mechanical + shot + reverb tail on separate 3D players.

## Multiplayer (short)

Client predicts VFX/tracers; server validates hits (`rpc` + rewind). Never trust client damage. ENet/UDP, not TCP. Server wins on mismatch — show no-reg feedback.
