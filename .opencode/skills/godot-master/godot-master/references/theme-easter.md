description: "Apply a Classic Easter seasonal overlay: pastel Theme/StyleBox injection, confetti/shimmer VFX, elastic juice, mesh surface_override painting, cursor/audio swaps, and a date-window activation gate with player opt-out. Use when shipping holiday skins, April events, or egg-hunt juice without mutating shared .mesh/.tres assets. Keywords: pastel, seasonal Theme, StyleBox, confetti, Easter egg, surface_override, TRANS_ELASTIC, Disable Seasonal Themes, activation gate."

## Overview
Seasonal "Easter-fy" toolkit: bright pastels, bouncy juice, egg/bunny iconography — gated by calendar + settings.

**MANDATORY first read:** [easter_seasonal_activation_gate.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_seasonal_activation_gate.gd) — date window, `Disable Seasonal Themes` opt-out (`user://settings.cfg`), and Dev Override. Call `refresh_activation()` when settings change; never poll the calendar in `_process`.

**Prerequisite:** Do **NOT Load** [godot-ui-theming](ui-theming.md) until a base `Theme` resource exists — seasonal overlays inject StyleBox overrides; they do not replace foundational Theme authoring.

## Seasonal Bootstrap (ordered)

1. **Gate** — Attach [easter_seasonal_activation_gate.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_seasonal_activation_gate.gd); call `refresh_activation()` on `_ready` and when settings change.
2. **Theme** — If gate active: **MANDATORY** [easter_runtime_ui_themer.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_runtime_ui_themer.gd) using tokens from [easter_pastel_color_palette.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_pastel_color_palette.gd).
3. **Audio** — **MANDATORY** [easter_seasonal_audio_swapper.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_seasonal_audio_swapper.gd) to map standard UI SFX → seasonal streams.
4. **Juice** — Layer confetti/shimmer/cursor/wobble scripts only after steps 1–3 pass (gate off = skip 2–4 entirely).

## Decision Tree — Alternate Painters (pick one)

| Context | Use | Do NOT also wire |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| 3D mesh seasonal tint via `surface_override` | [easter_mesh_painter_override.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_mesh_painter_override.gd) | [easter_palette_override.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_palette_override.gd) on same mesh |
| 2D/modulate or material slot swap already wired | [easter_palette_override.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_palette_override.gd) or [seasonal_material_swapper.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_seasonal_material_swapper.gd) | mesh_painter on the same target |

Alternate painters — see **Decision Tree — Alternate Painters** above; pick one path per target.

## Visual Guidelines
- **Colors:** Import tokens from [easter_pastel_color_palette.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_pastel_color_palette.gd) (`PINK`, `BLUE`, `YELLOW`, `MINT`, `PURPLE`) — never paste ad-hoc hex laundry lists into features.
- **Shapes:** Rounded corners (`corner_radius` > 8–12). Avoid sharp edges / high-contrast blacks.
- **VFX:** Confetti, sparkles, ribbons via confetti/shimmer scripts.

## NEVER Do (Expert Easter Rules)

### Aesthetics & Juice
- **NEVER use sharp edges or high-contrast blacks** — Easter aesthetics favor rounded corners (`corner_radius > 12`) and soft pastel tones.
- **NEVER use standard linear scaling for pops** — Linear scaling feels 'robotic.' Always use `TRANS_ELASTIC` or `TRANS_QUART` for organic eggs.
- **NEVER use billboarding for Easter particles** — In close-up UI or VR, billboard sparkles look flat. Use mesh-based particles or axial rotation.

### Logic & Performance
- **NEVER modify the original .mesh or .tres resource** — Swapping materials on a shared Resource changes it for EVERY instance in the game. Always use `surface_override` or `duplicate()`.
- **NEVER run date-checks in _process** — Checking the system calendar every frame is wasteful. Run `Time.get_date_dict_from_system()` once on `_ready` or event trigger via the activation gate.
- **NEVER ignore the 'No-Seasonal' toggle** — Some players hate seasonal overrides. Always provide a 'Disable Seasonal Themes' option in settings (wired through the gate's ConfigFile keys).

## Elite Theming Hooks

- **Dynamic Z-Ordering**: Use `RenderingServer.canvas_item_set_draw_index()` to dynamically move collected egg particles to the front of the UI stack without reparenting nodes.
- **Physics Interpolation**: When using `TRANS_ELASTIC` tweens on physics-driven eggs, invoke `RenderingServer.canvas_item_reset_physics_interpolation()` to prevent visual "jitter" on the first frame of the pop animation.
- **StyleBox Overrides**: Use `Control.add_theme_stylebox_override("panel", my_stylebox)` instead of modifying the global Theme to isolate seasonal changes to specific UI modules.

## Expert Easter Implementation

### 1. Custom-Mouse-Cursor (Juice)
**MANDATORY:** [easter_custom_cursor_manager.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_custom_cursor_manager.gd) — always set a `hotspot` (bunny-ear tip / base).

### 2. Themed-Sound-Loaders
**MANDATORY:** [easter_seasonal_audio_swapper.gd](../scripts/theme_easter_easter_seasonal_audio_swapper.gd) — Resource map of original → seasonal `AudioStream` pairs.

### 3. World-Environment-Override (Spring Glow)
Tween `Environment` ambient/tonemap/fog during a transition — never hard-cut colors mid-frame.

```gdscript
func _apply_spring_env(env: Environment) -> void:
    var tween := create_tween()
    tween.tween_property(env, "ambient_light_color", EasterPastelColorPalette.YELLOW, 2.0)
    tween.tween_property(env, "tonemap_exposure", 1.2, 2.0)
    tween.tween_property(env, "fog_light_color", EasterPastelColorPalette.BLUE, 2.0)
```
