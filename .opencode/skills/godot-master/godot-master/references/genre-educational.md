## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Pedagogy & Flow
- NEVER punish failure with a "Game Over"; strictly use **"Try Again"** or **Contextual Hints** to ensure a safe, encouraging learning environment.
- NEVER separate learning from gameplay ("Chocolate-covered broccoli"); strictly ensure the **mechanic IS the learning** (e.g., math-based trajectory calc).
- NEVER use walls of text for instructions; strictly use **Show, Don't Tell** methods: interactive diagrams, non-verbal tutorials, or 3-second looping GIFs.
- NEVER skip **Spaced Repetition** logic; strictly ensure successfully answered questions reappear at increasing intervals to verify long-term retention.
- NEVER focus on failure; strictly prominently display **Mastery %**, **XP Bars**, and **Skill Trees** to motivate through visible progress.
- NEVER assume a fixed difficulty; strictly implement **Dynamic Scaffolding** that adjusts challenge based on the student's mastery level to keep them in the "Zone of Proximal Development".
- NEVER hardcode student stats in UI components; strictly use **`Resource` scripts (`StudentProfile`)** to decouple student data from the presentation layer for persistence and scalability.
- NEVER build custom debug dashboards for performance tracking during development; strictly use **`Performance.add_custom_monitor()`** to inject live student metrics into the Godot Editor Debugger.

### Technical & Accessibility
- NEVER hardcode text into UI; strictly use **Translation Keys (PO files)** for internationalization and classroom localized support.
- NEVER force TTS without user consent; strictly provide an in-game toggle and respect OS-level screen reader settings.
- NEVER use absolute pixel positioning; strictly use the **Anchoring & Container** system for responsive scaling across tablets and classroom laptops.
- NEVER perform heavy data grading on the main thread; strictly use **WorkerThreadPool** to prevent UI freezes during automated assessments.
- NEVER forget to handle **IME updates**; strictly monitor `NOTIFICATION_OS_IME_UPDATE` for complex character input support (e.g., East Asian).
- NEVER ignore `mouse_filter` on overlays; strictly set to `PASS` to prevent invisible containers from silently consuming clicks.
- NEVER update static strings in `_process()`; strictly update labels ONLY on state change events to save mobile/tablet battery.
- NEVER embed sensitive database credentials in exports; strictly use **Environment Variables** or proxy APIs for student data security.

## Core Loop
1. **Learn** → 2. **Apply** → 3. **Feedback** → 4. **Adapt** → 5. **Master**

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. UI | `godot-ui-rich-text`, `godot-ui-theming` | Readable text, drag-and-drop answers |
| 2. Data | `godot-save-load-systems` | Student profiles, progress tracking |
| 3. Logic | `godot-state-machine-advanced` | Quiz flow (Question → Answer → Result) |
| 4. Juice | `godot-particles`, `godot-tweening` | Making learning feel rewarding |
| 5. Meta | `godot-scene-management` | Navigating between lessons and map |
| 6. Balance | `godot-monte-carlo-balancer` | Override bands to ~70% flow / mastery |

## Architecture Decision Tree

Pick the owner script; keep SKILL free of duplicate `StudentProfile` / quiz_manager paste-ups.

| Need | Decision | MANDATORY script |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Track mastery / XP / badges | One `StudentProfile` Resource + ConfigFile I/O | [student_progress_config.gd](../scripts/genre_educational_student_progress_config.gd) |
| Keep learners in flow (~70%) | Windowed success ratio + hint branch | [adaptive_difficulty_adjuster.gd](../scripts/genre_educational_adaptive_difficulty_adjuster.gd) |
| Long-term retention | Interval queue (success → longer delay; fail → sooner) | [spaced_repetition_scheduler.gd](../scripts/genre_educational_spaced_repetition_scheduler.gd) |
| Prerequisite lesson map | Curriculum Resource graph (id + required_topics) — data only, no UI | Peer `godot-resource-data-patterns` |
| Grade without hitching | Offload scoring | [threaded_scoring_engine.gd](../scripts/genre_educational_threaded_scoring_engine.gd) |
| Classroom a11y | TTS + locale + focus + anchors | `tts_manager` / `dynamic_localization` / `focus_navigation_manager` / `adaptive_ui_anchors` |
| Live debugger metrics | `Performance.add_custom_monitor("edu/...")` — no custom dashboards | (inline one-liner OK) |

**StudentProfile (single shape):** `@export` mastery Dictionary + XP; emit change signals; persist via `student_progress_config.gd`. Do not redefine the class twice in this skill.

**Quiz curtain:** state machine owns Question → Answer → Result → Adapt; spaced-repetition + adaptive-difficulty scripts decide *what* is next — do not inline a full `quiz_manager.gd` tutorial here.

## Juice (Duolingo Effect)
Learning is hard — reward effort: satisfying SFX, particles on correct, Tweened XP bars. Pedagogue first; juice never substitutes for spaced repetition / ZPD scaffolding.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Chocolate-Covered Broccoli** — mechanic must *be* the learning.
2. **Punishing Failure** — Try Again / hint, never Game Over for wrong answers.
3. **Wall of Text** — show/interact first; use `text_reveal_effect` / rich-text meta.
