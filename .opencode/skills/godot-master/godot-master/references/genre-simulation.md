## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Simulation & Economy
- NEVER use floating-point for primary currency; strictly use **Integer Cents** (or fixed-point math) to prevent accumulated precision errors in financial models.
- NEVER process 1000+ entities individually in `_process()`; strictly use a **Tick Manager** to batch updates or process entities in rotating pools.
- NEVER rely on linear cost scaling; strictly use **Exponential Growth** (`Base * pow(1.15, Level)`) to maintain challenge and strategic tension.
- NEVER hide critical metrics from the player; strictly provide **Detailed Breakdowns** (Income vs. Expense) so players can make optimization-based decisions.
- NEVER allow infinite resource stacking; strictly enforce **Logistical Caps** (warehouses/silos) to create meaningful space-management gameplay loops.
- NEVER let the early game become a "Waiting Simulator"; strictly **Front-Load Decisions** and quick early wins to build player momentum.
- NEVER modify a shared Resource directly; strictly use **`duplicate()`** to avoid unintentionally updating every building of that type.
- NEVER tie simulation logic to the visual framerate; strictly use **`_physics_process()`** or delta accumulators for deterministic simulation results.

### Performance & Threading
- NEVER update UI labels every frame; strictly use **Event-Driven Signals** to refresh UI ONLY when the underlying data changes.
- NEVER run heavy economic loops synchronously; strictly use **WorkerThreadPool** to offload complex calculations and prevent UI stutters.
- NEVER store massive resource data as Nodes; strictly use **`RefCounted`** or **Data Resources** to avoid the memory/CPU overhead of the SceneTree.
- NEVER ignore **`OS.low_processor_usage_mode`**; strictly enable it for stationary management screens to save massive CPU/Battery life.
- NEVER manipulate the SceneTree from background threads; strictly use **`call_deferred()`** for thread-safe UI updates.
- NEVER parse large JSON save files on the main thread; strictly use **Threaded Serialization** or optimized binary `.res` formats.
- NEVER use standard equality (==) for needs; strictly use **`is_equal_approx()`** to prevent floating-point jitter failures in logic gates.

## 🛠 Expert Components (scripts/)

> **MANDATORY reads** before implementing the matching system:
> 1. [tycoon_economy.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_tycoon_economy.gd) — integer cents / discrete stocks
> 2. [sim_tick_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_sim_tick_manager.gd) — `_physics_process` tick accumulator
> 3. [simulation_tick_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_simulation_tick_controller.gd) — speed / pause control surface

### Original Expert Patterns
- [tycoon_economy.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_tycoon_economy.gd) - Multi-resource economy with **integer** currency (cents).
- [sim_tick_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_sim_tick_manager.gd) - Framerate-decoupled game-hour ticks on physics.

### Modular Components
- [simulation_tick_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_simulation_tick_controller.gd) - UI/speed wiring for the tick manager.
- [economy_graph_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_economy_graph_manager.gd) - Producer/consumer graph edges.
- [npc_schedule_agent.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_npc_schedule_agent.gd) - Schedule-driven NPC agents on ticks.

## Core Loop
1. **Place/build** → 2. **Tick economy** → 3. **Read income vs expense** → 4. **Unlock / expand** → 5. **Optimize logistics**

## Decision Trees

### Currency & time (must match NEVER)
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Money / wallets | **MANDATORY** [tycoon_economy.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_tycoon_economy.gd) — integer cents, never float primary |
| Sim clock | **MANDATORY** [sim_tick_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_sim_tick_manager.gd) — accumulator on `_physics_process` |
| Speed UI | [simulation_tick_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_simulation_tick_controller.gd) |

### Tick rate vs UI vs threads
| Entity / load | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| < ~200 entities | Tick signal → direct update; UI via `resource_changed` only |
| Hundreds of agents | Rotate pools per tick; [npc_schedule_agent.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_npc_schedule_agent.gd) |
| Heavy graph / path logistics | Offload with WorkerThreadPool; `call_deferred` UI — see [simulation_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_simulation_patterns.gd) / [economy_graph_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_simulation_economy_graph_manager.gd) |
| Stationary management screens | Enable `OS.low_processor_usage_mode` |

Do **not** re-inline TycoonEconomy / SimulationTime / Worker tutorials — load the scripts.

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Data | `resources`, `godot-economy-system` | Stocks / sinks |
| 2. Time | tick manager | Deterministic hours |
| 3. Agents | schedules / nav | NPCs & logistics |
| 4. Perf | WorkerThreadPool | Heavy ticks |
| 5. Balance | `godot-monte-carlo-balancer` | Bankruptcy / growth bands |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Float money | Integer cents in tycoon_economy |
| `_process` sim step | Physics accumulator tick manager |
| UI every frame | Signal on resource_changed only |

### Official Documentation
