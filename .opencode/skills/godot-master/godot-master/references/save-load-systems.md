## NEVER Do

- **NEVER save without a version field** — When you update your game's data structure, old saves will break. Always include a `"version": "1.0.0"` field and implement migration logic.
- **NEVER use absolute OS paths** — Hardcoding `C:/Users/...` will break on every other machine. Always use the `user://` protocol, which Godot maps to the correct OS-specific app data folder.
- **NEVER attempt to save Node references directly** — Nodes are objects, not raw data. Extract the necessary primitive data (positions, health, levels) into a `Dictionary` or `Resource` instead.
- **NEVER forget to close FileAccess handles** — Leaving a file open can lead to handle leaks and save-file corruption. In Godot 4, files auto-close when the variable goes out of scope, but explicit `close()` is safer for long-running logic.
- **NEVER use JSON for very large binary data** — Storing 10MB of texture data as Base64 in JSON is slow and bloats file size. Use binary `store_var()` or separate dedicated asset files.
- **NEVER trust loaded data without validation** — Users can edit save files. Always use `data.get("field", default_value)` and validate that numbers are within expected ranges to prevent crashes.
- **NEVER trigger a save during high-frequency physics or animation updates** — A crash mid-write will corrupt the file. Save only on explicit game events like entering a menu, finishing a level, or at a checkpoint.
- **NEVER modify a save Dictionary while iterating over its keys** — Calling `erase()` or `add()` inside a loop over the same dictionary causes iteration errors. Use `data.duplicate()` to iterate safely.
- **NEVER store raw passwords or sensitive credentials in unencrypted JSON** — If you have sensitive data, use `FileAccess.open_encrypted_with_pass()` to secure it.
- **NEVER use ResourceLoader.load() for massive scenes on the main thread** — It causes a visible freeze. Use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` to load levels in the background.
- **NEVER rely on get_instance_id() for cross-session identification** — These IDs are assigned at runtime and change every time the game restarts. Generate your own persistent `String` UUIDs for game objects.
- **NEVER forget to call duplicate(true) on a loaded Resource stats block** — If multiple enemies load the same "goblin_stats.tres", they will all share the same health pool unless duplicated.
- **NEVER use the "allow_objects" flag in store_var/get_var for untrusted data** — Setting this to `true` allows full object decoding, which is a major security risk for saves downloaded from the web.
- **NEVER use JSON for data requiring strict type preservation** — JSON converts `Vector3` to a string or dictionary. For strict data types, use `var_to_bytes()` or a binary format.
- **NEVER leave internal metadata (set_meta) in persistent dictionaries** — This unnecessarily inflates save file size. Clean your dictionaries before serialization.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the script for the chosen format before writing SaveManager code.

### [save_load_patterns.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_load_patterns.gd)
**MANDATORY** for JSON / binary / PERSIST collect — patterns default `store_var(..., false)`.

### [save_migration_manager.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_migration_manager.gd)
**MANDATORY** when any save has a `version` field that can lag the build.

### [save_system_encryption.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_system_encryption.gd)
**MANDATORY** before encrypted slots — password from secure storage / user secret, never hardcoded in examples.

### [save_integrity_validator.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_integrity_validator.gd)
Rolling `.bak` + SHA-256 verify before trusting a slot; fall back to backup on mismatch.

---

## Deep dive (load on demand)

**MANDATORY** for JSON/PERSIST walkthroughs, binary examples, gotchas, and elite encrypted paths — [references/save-patterns-deep.md](save-load-systems-save-patterns-deep.md). Do **not** paste Step 1–3 Autoload tutorials into scenes.

## Expert WHY (critical)

> **CAUTION:** Baseline tutorials used `store_var(data, true)`. Untrusted `user://` saves must **`allow_objects=false`** — RCE risk on modded/workshop files.

- **Vectors in JSON** — store `{x,y,z}` components; JSON does not round-trip `Vector3` faithfully.
- **Rolling backup** — crash mid-write corrupts primary; copy to `.bak` before overwrite ([save_integrity_validator.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_integrity_validator.gd)).
- **When to save** — menu/checkpoint/level complete only — never per physics frame.

## Decision Tree: Pick a Persistence Shape

| Need | Format | MANDATORY |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Human-readable, small/medium progress | JSON + `version` | [save_load_patterns.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_load_patterns.gd) |
| Type-faithful Variants / larger blobs | Binary `store_var` with **`allow_objects=false`** | same |
| Typed Resource trees / inspector schemas | `ResourceSaver` / `.tres`/`.res` | Peer `godot-resource-data-patterns` |
| Many scene nodes auto-collect | PERSIST group + `save()`/`load()` | [save_load_patterns.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_load_patterns.gd) |
| Schema evolved | Migrate then load | [save_migration_manager.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_migration_manager.gd) |
| Anti-tamper / sensitive fields | Encrypted FileAccess | [save_system_encryption.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_system_encryption.gd) |

Do **not** paste Step 1–3 JSON Autoload tutorials here — implement from the scripts.

## `allow_objects` Trust Boundary

Default **always** `store_var(data, false)` / `get_var(false)`.

| Case | `allow_objects` | Rule |
|------|-----------------|------|
| Player `user://` saves, workshop mods, downloads | `false` | NEVER true — RCE risk |
| Trusted local only (your own tooling, offline debug fixtures you control) | `true` only if unavoidable | Document why; never ship as default; prefer Resources / Dictionaries of primitives |

Encrypted elite paths still use `false` unless the payload is explicitly trusted-local and non-user-editable.

## Golden Path (version → migrate → backup → atomic write)

1. **Version field** on every save blob.
2. **Migrate** via [save_migration_manager.gd](../scripts/save_load_systems_save_migration_manager.gd) when versions differ.
3. **Backup** existing file (`DirAccess.copy_absolute` to `.bak`) before overwrite.
4. **Write** to temp then rename, or write-after-backup; validate open errors.
5. **Integrity** optional: `FileAccess.get_sha256` compare; fall back to backup on mismatch.
6. **Paths** only `user://` — never absolute OS paths.
7. **When to save** — menu, checkpoint, level complete — never per physics frame.

Settings may use `ConfigFile` separately from run-progress JSON/binary.
