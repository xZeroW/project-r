## Core Loop
1.  **Prepare**: Build/upgrade towers with available currency
2.  **Wave**: Enemies spawn and traverse path toward goal
3.  **Defend**: Towers auto-target and damage enemies
4.  **Reward**: Kills grant currency
5.  **Escalate**: Waves increase in difficulty/complexity

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Design & Strategy
- NEVER make all towers have the same niche; strictly ensure distinct specialties: **Aura Slow**, **Armor Piercing**, **Anti-Air**, **Burst Sniper**, and **Splash Damage**.
- NEVER allow a "Death Spiral" with no exit; strictly provide small **comeback bonuses** or interest on saved gold to prevent early inevitable failure.
- NEVER make early waves feel like busywork; strictly provide an **"Early Call" bonus** to skip wait times and accelerate engagement.
- NEVER trust client-side economy updates; strictly require the **authoritative server** to validate currency addition and tower purchases in co-op.

### Pathing & Placement
- NEVER allow the player to "Seal" the exit in mazing games; strictly validate path existence with **`NavigationServer2D.map_get_path()`** before finalizing tower placement.
- NEVER use synchronous `bake_navigation_polygon()` for mazing; strictly offload to a **worker thread** to prevent 100ms+ frame hitches during placement.
- NEVER use global coordinates for grid logic; strictly convert to **Vector2i/Vector3i** to ensure pixel-perfect tower alignment.

### Performance & Systems
- NEVER call `get_overlapping_bodies()` every frame; strictly use **signals** (`body_entered`/`body_exited`) to maintain a local target cache.
- NEVER use `_process()` for projectile movement if count > 500; strictly use the **PhysicsServer2D/3D** directly for high-performance bullet-hell tiers.
- NEVER spawn hundreds of projectiles as full Nodes; strictly use **Object Pooling** to reuse resources and avoid garbage collection stutters.
- NEVER use standard Strings for priorities; strictly use `StringName` (&"first", &"strongest") for O(1) hash comparisons in targeting loops.
- NEVER ignore the `progress` property on PathFollow nodes; strictly use it as the O(1) way to identify the **target closest to exit**.
- NEVER process tower search logic every frame; strictly **throttle ACQUIRE searches** (e.g., every 5-10 frames) to save significant CPU cycles.
- NEVER scale Tower `CollisionShape` non-uniformly; strictly adjust the radius property of the Shape resource to preserve collision math.
- NEVER delete enemies immediately on death; strictly use **set_deferred("disabled", true)** and wait one frame to prevent physics server crashes.
- NEVER hardcode waves in huge switch statements; strictly use **Custom Resources (.tres)** for clean balancing and sequence editing.

## 🛠 Expert Components (scripts/)

### Original Expert Patterns
- [wave_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_wave_manager.gd) - Professional wave orchestrator with Resource-based enemy composition and cleanup.
- [tower.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower.gd) - Base turret class with FSM state management and firing logic.
- [tower_targeting_system.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_targeting_system.gd) - Autonomous priority logic (First/Last/Strongest/Weakest) for efficient targeting.

### Modular Components
- [tower_defense_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_defense_patterns.gd) - Collection of patterns for furthest-target logic and PhysicsServer projectile optimization.

## Decision Trees (MANDATORY script reads)

### Path style
| Style | Approach | Scripts / APIs |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Fixed lanes | `Path2D` / `PathFollow2D` `progress` | [wave_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_wave_manager.gd), [wave_resource_spawner.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_wave_resource_spawner.gd) |
| Mazing | Seal-check before place | `NavigationServer2D.map_get_path` / `AStarGrid2D` (NEVER) |
| Organic curves | Bezier PathFollow `progress` | Prefer PathFollow over per-frame seek |

### Targeting priority
| Priority | Sort key | **MANDATORY** |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| FIRST | Highest `progress` (closest to exit) | [tower_targeting_system.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_targeting_system.gd) |
| LAST | Lowest `progress` | same — LAST implemented |
| STRONGEST / WEAKEST | `health` desc / asc | same — WEAKEST implemented |

Use **signal-cached** range `Area` enter/exit + **frame-sliced** acquire (`acquire_interval_frames`). Never `get_overlapping_bodies()` every frame.

### Economy
| Concern | Rule | Script |
|---------|------|--------|
| Wave composition | Resource `.tres` waves | [wave_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_wave_manager.gd) |
| Co-op purchases | Server validates gold | [tower_defense_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_defense_patterns.gd) |
| Comeback | Interest / early-call bonus | Design-level — not tower FSM |

## PhysicsServer Projectile Golden Path

When count > ~500:

1. **MANDATORY** [tower_defense_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_defense_patterns.gd) `spawn_fast_bullet` (`PhysicsServer3D` kinematic RIDs).
2. Pool RIDs; AoE via `intersect_shape`; defer collision disable on death.
3. Modest counts: [homing_projectile_3d.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_homing_projectile_3d.gd) / pooled Nodes OK.

## Tower FSM

**MANDATORY**: [tower.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower.gd) for idle → acquire → windup → fire. Targeting stays in [tower_targeting_system.gd](../scripts/genre_tower_defense_tower_targeting_system.gd).
