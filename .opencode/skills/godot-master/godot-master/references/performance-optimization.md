## NEVER Do in Performance Optimization

- **NEVER optimize without profiling first** — "I think physics is slow" without data? Premature optimization. ALWAYS use Debug → Profiler (F3) to identify actual bottleneck [20].
- **NEVER use `print()` in release builds** — `print()` every frame = file I/O bottleneck + log spam. Use `@warning_ignore` or conditional `if OS.is_debug_build():` [21].
- **NEVER ignore `VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D` for off-screen entities** — Enemies processing logic off-screen = wasted CPU. Disable `set_process(false)` when `screen_exited` [22].
- **NEVER instantiate nodes in hot loops** — `for i in 1000: var bullet = Bullet.new()` = 1000 allocations. Use object pools, reuse instances [23].
- **NEVER use `get_node()` in `_process()`** — Calling `get_node("Player")` 60x/sec = tree traversal spam. Cache in `@onready var player := $Player` [24].
- **NEVER forget to batch draw calls** — 1000 unique sprites = 1000 draw calls. Use TextureAtlas (sprite sheets) + MultiMesh for instanced rendering [25].
- **NEVER block the main thread for heavy operations** — Avoid `OS.delay_msec()` or long synchronous data processing. Use `WorkerThreadPool` to keep framerates steady.
- **NEVER use complex collision shapes for physics queries** — High-poly convex shapes are expensive to resolve. Prefer simplified primitives (Circle, Rectangle, Box).
- **NEVER forget to disconnect local lambda signals** — Anonymous lambdas connected to global signals can cause memory leaks if the capturing object is freed.
- **NEVER use large textures without VRAM compression** — VRAM is limited. Use **S3TC/BPTC** for desktop (DirectX/Vulkan) and **ETC2** for mobile. Note: Disable compression for Pixel Art to avoid artifacts [13].
- **NEVER perform tree modifications during physics steps** — Adding/removing nodes during `_inter_ray` or `_physics_process` can lock the physics server. Use `call_deferred`.
- **NEVER skip shader pre-warming in the Compatibility renderer** — Unlike Forward+, OpenGL lacks Ubershaders. Pre-instantiate every mesh/VFX in front of the camera for 1 frame behind a loading screen to avoid hitches [21].

**Debug → Profiler** (F3)

Tabs:
- **Time**: Function call times
- **Memory**: RAM usage
- **Network**: RPCs, bandwidth
- **Physics**: Collision checks

## Profiler-Tab Decision Tree

> Open **Debug → Profiler** first. **MANDATORY** load only the script for the hot tab/symptom.
>
> **Do NOT Load** every perf script for a single hitch.

## Expert Pointers (keep short)

- Compatibility renderer: pre-warm pipelines (hidden camera + unique meshes/materials one frame). Forward+/Mobile: Ubershaders still need instantiate-once detection.
- VRAM: S3TC/BPTC desktop, ETC2 mobile; skip compression for pixel art.
- AStar/path budgets belong in [navigation_agent_optimization.gd](../scripts/performance_optimization_navigation_agent_optimization.gd) — do not paste thrashy queue snippets as the golden path.

## Deep dives (on demand)
