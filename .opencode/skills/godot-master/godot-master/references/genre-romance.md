description: "Expert blueprint for romance games and dating sims (Tokimeki Memorial, Monster Prom, Persona social links) focusing on affection systems, multi-stat relationships, dated events, and route branching. Use when building relationship-centric games, social simulations, or otome games. Keywords romance, dating sim, affection system, relationship stats, date events, character routes, love interest."
---

## Core Loop
1.  **Meet**: Encounter potential love interests and establish baseline rapport.
2.  **Date**: Engage in structured events to learn preferences and test compatibility.
3.  **Deepen**: Invest resources (time, gifts, choices) to increase affection/stats.
4.  **Branch**: Story diverges into character-specific "Routes" based on major milestones.
5.  **Resolve**: Reach a specialized ending (Good/Normal/Bad) based on relationship quality.

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Romance & NPC Logic
- NEVER create "Vending Machine" romance; strictly incorporate variables like **NPC Mood**, **Timing**, and **Multi-Stat Thresholds** to ensure characters feel autonomous.
- NEVER use binary Affection (Love/Hate); strictly use a **Multi-Axial Model** (Attraction, Trust, Comfort) for believable psychological depth.
- NEVER focus on 100% opaque stats; strictly provide **Visible Indicators** (heart UI, blushing text, pulsing hearts) to help players make informed choices.
- NEVER use the "Same Date Order" trap; strictly implement a **Repetition Penalty** (~30%) for visiting the same location twice in a row.
- NEVER forget "Missable" Milestones; strictly ensure meaningful consequences (e.g., missing events due to poor scheduling) to add weight to the experience.
- NEVER ignore NPC Autonomy; strictly allow NPCs to have their own **Schedules** and the ability to **Reject** the player based on low trust or conflicting events.
- NEVER use polling (`_process`) for NPC schedule checks; strictly use a **Signal-Driven TimeManager** (Autoload) to broadcast hour/day changes for performant state updates.
- NEVER hardcode character references for jealousy logic; strictly use **Groups (`add_to_group`)** to broadcast romantic events across the scene for decoupled, autonomous NPC reactions.

### Technical & UI
- NEVER use `_process` for typewriter text; strictly use **Tweens on `visible_ratio`** for frame-independent, smooth reveals.
- NEVER parse massive narrative files on the main thread; strictly use **`ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()`** to prevent transition stutters.
- NEVER use exact float math for affection checks; strictly use **`is_equal_approx()`** to avoid jitter-based logic failures.
- NEVER structure complex dialogue purely in code; strictly design dialogue trees as **Custom `Resource` classes** to decouple narrative data from logic.
- NEVER rely on the global OS clock for timed choices; strictly use **`SceneTreeTimer`** which respects `Engine.time_scale` and pause states.
- NEVER leave invisible controls with `MOUSE_FILTER_STOP`; strictly set to `IGNORE` or `PASS` on non-opaque layers to avoid blocking dialogue progression.
- NEVER hardcode dialogue strings; strictly map text to **Localization Keys** and retrieve via `tr()` for internationalization.
- NEVER use absolute pixel positioning for interfaces; strictly rely on **Anchoring & Containers** for responsive scaling across devices.

## 🛠 Expert Components (scripts/)

> **MANDATORY reads** before implementing the matching system:
> 1. [affection_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_affection_manager.gd) — multi-axial Attraction/Trust/Comfort
> 2. [date_event_system.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_date_event_system.gd) — dates + repetition penalty
> 3. [route_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_route_manager.gd) — route lock / CG flags

- [romance_patterns.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_romance_patterns.gd) - Typewriter tweens and heart-burst juice helpers.
- [ui_feedback.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_ui_feedback.gd) - Heart-burst Tween juice at affection milestones.
- [npc_schedule.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_npc_schedule.gd) - `NPCSchedule` Resource + hour_changed routing.
- [seasonal_dialogue.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_seasonal_dialogue.gd) - Season/festival dialogue key overrides.

## Core Loop
1. **Meet** → 2. **Schedule / talk** → 3. **Date / gift** → 4. **Milestone** → 5. **Route lock or continue parallel**

## Decision Trees

### Affection & dialogue
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Multi-axis stats | **MANDATORY** [affection_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_affection_manager.gd) |
| Global HUD / jealousy groups | [global_affection_tracker.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_global_affection_tracker.gd) + `call_group` |
| Mood-gated lines | [romance_mood_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_romance_mood_manager.gd) |
| Portrait tags | [dialogue_expression_parser.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_dialogue_expression_parser.gd) |

### Routes vs parallel dating
| Situation | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Early game exploration | Keep routes **unlocked**; raise Attraction freely; Trust gates deeper personal scenes |
| Mid-game exclusive confession | **Lock route** via [route_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_romance_route_manager.gd) when Trust ≥ threshold **and** player accepts — freeze rival romance flags |
| Parallel dating fantasy | Allow multiple Attraction tracks, but jealousy groups cut Trust on discovered overlaps |
| Confession readiness | Attraction opens the prompt; **Trust** decides success vs soft rejection; Comfort reduces timed-choice panic fail |

Do **not** re-inline affection/date/route class stubs — load the scripts above.

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Stats | `dictionaries`, `resources` | Multi-axis affection |
| 2. Timeline | `autoload-architecture`, `signals` | Schedules / days |
| 3. Narrative | `godot-dialogue-system`, `visual-novel` | Branching choices |
| 4. Persist | `godot-save-load-systems` | Routes, CGs, flags |
| 5. Juice | `ui-theming`, `godot-tweening` | Hearts / blush |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Vending-machine romance | Multi-axis + repetition penalty on dates |
| Opaque stats | Surface Attraction/Trust/Comfort deltas in UI |
| Garbled script index | Use filenames above (no broken path fragments) |

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [romance-systems-deep.md](genre-romance-romance-systems-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Affection Manager (The Heart)
Handles complex relationship stats and gift preferences for all characters.

```gdscript

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **Resources for Characters**: Use `CharacterProfile` resources to store base stats, sprites, and gift preferences.
*   **RichTextLabel Animations**: Use custom BBCode for "blushing" text (pulsing pink) or "nervous" text (shaking).
*   **Dialogic Integration**: While this skill focuses on the *systems*, pairing it with Godot's **Dialogic** plugin is highly recommended for handling the actual dialogue boxes.
