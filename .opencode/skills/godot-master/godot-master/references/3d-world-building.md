# 3D World Building

Expert guidance for level design with GridMaps, CSG bake, and occlusion — not lighting/atmosphere authorship.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER forget to bake GridMap navigation** — GridMaps don't auto-generate navigation meshes. Use EditorPlugin or manual NavigationRegion3D.
- **NEVER use CSG for final game geometry** — CSG is for prototyping. Convert to static meshes for performance (use "Bake CSG Mesh" in editor).
- **NEVER scale GridMap cell size after placing tiles** — Changing `cell_size` doesn't update existing tiles, causing misalignment. Set it once at the start.
- **NEVER ship a MeshLibrary item without verifying collision** — Call `mesh_library.get_item_shapes(tile_index)` (or inspect the source scene StaticBody3D + CollisionShape3D) before convert; empty shapes spawn visual-only geometry players fall through.
- **NEVER bake CSG before the combiner has a settled frame** — Extract meshes only after `await get_tree().process_frame` (see [safe_csg_baking.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_safe_csg_baking.gd)); baking mid-recompute yields empty or stale ArrayMesh data. Order: finish boolean edits → wait one frame → bake → delete CSG → add collision.
- **NEVER animate CSG nodes during gameplay** — Moving a CSG node within another forces the CPU to recalculate the boolean geometry, causing significant performance drops.
- **NEVER place generic logic nodes in a GridMap** — GridMap is highly optimized only for meshes, navigation, and collision. Use proxy tiles + scripts for spawns/triggers.
- **NEVER use non-manifold meshes in CSG** — Custom CSGMesh3D assets must be manifold (closed, no self-intersections). Non-manifold meshes break the CSG algorithm.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.
> **Do NOT Load** lighting/sky/fog scripts or deep Environment tutorials here — route to [godot-3d-lighting](3d-lighting.md).

### [collision_gen.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_collision_gen.gd)
Automatic collision shape generation from meshes. Use when importing models without collision or for procedural geometry.

### [gridmap_runtime_builder.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_gridmap_runtime_builder.gd)
**Sole streaming / runtime GridMap entry** — batch tile placement, chunk-style rebuilds, and auto-navigation baking. Prefer this over ad-hoc WorldStreamer stubs.

### [csg_bake_tool.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_csg_bake_tool.gd)
EditorScript to bake CSG geometry to static meshes with proper materials and collision. Use when finalizing level prototypes.

### [safe_csg_baking.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_safe_csg_baking.gd)
Expert technique for safe CSG baking. Awaits the end of the frame before extracting baked meshes to avoid empty data.

### [lod_manager.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_lod_manager.gd)
Level-of-detail switching based on camera distance. Manages mesh swapping and visibility for large outdoor scenes.

### [occlusion_setup.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_occlusion_setup.gd)
OccluderInstance3D configuration for manual occlusion culling. Use for indoor levels with many rooms.

### [grid_map_logic_manager.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_grid_map_logic_manager.gd)
Proxy-tile pattern: replace invisible MeshLibrary markers with spawn/trigger scenes at `_ready`, then clear proxy cells.

### [world_streamer.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_world_streamer.gd)
`ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request` queue — stutter-free chunk instantiation after background load completes.

## Golden Path (GridMap / CSG / Occlusion)

1. **MeshLibrary** — Source scene: MeshInstance3D + StaticBody3D/CollisionShape3D → Convert To MeshLibrary → verify `get_item_shapes()`.
2. **GridMap** — Set `cell_size` once, place cells, bake NavigationRegion3D. Runtime rebuilds: **MANDATORY** [gridmap_runtime_builder.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_gridmap_runtime_builder.gd).
3. **CSG greybox** — Prototype with CSGCombiner3D → **MANDATORY** [safe_csg_baking.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_safe_csg_baking.gd) / [csg_bake_tool.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_csg_bake_tool.gd) → delete live CSG.
4. **Occlusion / LOD** — Indoor rooms: [occlusion_setup.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_occlusion_setup.gd). Distance swaps: [lod_manager.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_lod_manager.gd).
5. **Sky / fog / WorldEnvironment** — Out of scope; use peer **godot-3d-lighting** (keep only a DirectionalLight3D present if volumetric fog is enabled elsewhere).

## GridMap Fundamentals

### Setup (compact)

```gdscript
extends GridMap

func _ready() -> void:
    mesh_library = load("res://tilesets/dungeon_library.tres")
    cell_size = Vector3(2, 2, 2)  # Set once; never after tiles exist
```

Cell API: `set_cell_item(pos, index[, orientation])`, `get_cell_item`, `INVALID_CELL_ITEM`, `local_to_map` / `map_to_local`. For batch/runtime placement and nav bake, load [gridmap_runtime_builder.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_gridmap_runtime_builder.gd) — do not paste a custom chunk streamer.

### Collision verification

```gdscript
var shapes := mesh_library.get_item_shapes(tile_index)
if shapes.is_empty():
    push_error("Tile %d has no collision — fix MeshLibrary source scene" % tile_index)
```

---

## CSG Bake Order

1. Finish boolean edits under `CSGCombiner3D`.
2. `await get_tree().process_frame` (WHY: CSG dirty flags settle one frame late).
3. Bake to MeshInstance3D + collision via scripts above; remove CSG from exported scenes.
4. Never animate CSG at runtime.

Brush types (Box/Cylinder/Sphere/Polygon) are editor greybox tools only — not shipping geometry.

## Streaming Decision

| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Runtime GridMap tiles / chunk rebuild + nav bake | **MANDATORY** [gridmap_runtime_builder.gd](../scripts/3d_world_building_gridmap_runtime_builder.gd) |
| Large open-world scene streaming | Peer [godot-genre-open-world](genre-open-world.md) |
| Ad-hoc WorldStreamer inline stub | **Cut** — do not reintroduce incomplete load-from-file TODOs |

## Expert Techniques

### Spatially Partitioning MultiMeshes
Partition dense props into regional `MultiMeshInstance3D` nodes so frustum/occlusion can cull whole clusters (single MultiMesh AABB draws everything).

### GridMap Logic Proxies
Use invisible proxy tile IDs for spawns/triggers; at `_ready`, `get_used_cells_by_item`, instantiate logic scenes, clear proxy cells. Keep logic off the GridMap itself.

### Interior-Mapping
For city-scale fake interiors, use a spatial shader on window planes — peer [godot-shaders-basics](shaders-basics.md). Do not paste full shader recipes here.

### Edge Cases
- **No collision**: empty `get_item_shapes` → fix MeshLibrary source.
- **CSG z-fight**: tiny offset on subtraction brushes before bake.
