## MANDATORY script reads (start here)

1. [fps_camera_look.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_fps_camera_look.gd) — raw `_input` mouse look (yaw/pitch)  
2. [fps_movement_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_fps_movement_logic.gd) — accel/friction/air control  
3. [hitscan_weapon_query.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_hitscan_weapon_query.gd) — space-state hitscan  
4. [weapon_bobbing_system.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_weapon_bobbing_system.gd) — viewmodel bob/sway  

Also: [procedural_recoil_handler.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_procedural_recoil_handler.gd), [hitscan_weapon_logic.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_hitscan_weapon_logic.gd), [advanced_fps_controller.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_advanced_fps_controller.gd), [weapon_state_machine.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_weapon_state_machine.gd), [frame_perfect_input.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_frame_perfect_input.gd), [bullet_decal_spawner.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_bullet_decal_spawner.gd), [weapon_spread_calc.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_weapon_spread_calc.gd), [server_projectile_instance.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_server_projectile_instance.gd), [player_anim_bridge.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_player_anim_bridge.gd), [recoil_system.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_recoil_system.gd) (pattern + bloom), [aim_assist.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_aim_assist.gd) (controller friction/magnetism).  
`advanced_weapon_controller.gd` is shared theory — keep FPS feel in the scripts above; genre routing for TPS → sibling skill.

## Core Loop

`Move/Look → Aim → Fire (hitscan) → Recoil recover → Acquire`

## NEVER Do (FPS)

### Gunplay & registration
- **NEVER** hit-detect in `_process` — use `_physics_process` + `intersect_ray`.
- **NEVER** apply recoil only to the gun mesh — kick **camera** + bloom/spread.
- **NEVER** trust client damage — server authority + lag compensation.
- **NEVER** forget `exclude` / `add_exception` for the player RID.
- **NEVER** use `==` on float cooldowns — `is_equal_approx`.

### Input & movement
- **NEVER** poll mouse in `_physics_process` — `_input` / `_unhandled_input` for look.
- **NEVER** accumulate look on a raw `Transform3D` — store yaw/pitch floats.
- **NEVER** multiply velocity by `delta` before `move_and_slide()`.
- **NEVER** use `Transform3D.looking_at` for muzzle forward — use `-transform.basis.z`.

### Polish
- **NEVER** single `AudioStreamPlayer` for gunfire — layer mechanical + shot + tail.
- **NEVER** leave decals forever — fade/pool ([bullet_decal_spawner.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_bullet_decal_spawner.gd)).
- **NEVER** hardcode weapon stats — WeaponData Resources.
- **NEVER** use plain Strings for hot weapon states — `StringName`.

## Advanced FPS (keep)

### Viewmodel sway / bob
Procedural sine bob + look sway — [weapon_bobbing_system.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_weapon_bobbing_system.gd).

### Step-up
Ray forward/down from `step_height` when `is_on_wall()` after `move_and_slide()`; lift to step top for stairs.

### Tactical lean
Roll camera Z + local X offset from `Input.get_axis("lean_left","lean_right")` with lerp.

## Shared weapon theory

Hitscan vs projectile, spray patterns, and net prediction details that are not FPS-rig specific → [godot-genre-shooter](genre-shooter.md) + combat/multiplayer complements. Implement FPS fire path via [hitscan_weapon_query.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_hitscan_weapon_query.gd) + [procedural_recoil_handler.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_procedural_recoil_handler.gd) + [recoil_system.gd](../scripts/genre_shooter_fps_recoil_system.gd).

> **MANDATORY** for hitscan/projectile tradeoffs, three-layer recoil, aim assist, weapon balance matrices, and client prediction: [fps-weapon-theory.md](genre-shooter-fps-fps-weapon-theory.md). **Do NOT Load** after MANDATORY script reads unless extending beyond bob/step/lean.
