# Platform: VR

90+ FPS, comfort-first design, and motion control accuracy define VR development.

## NEVER Do (Expert VR Rules)

### Rendering & Comfort
- **NEVER drop below 90 FPS** — In VR, 72 FPS or less causes instant nausea. You MUST maintain at least 90 FPS (Meta Quest 2/3 typical) and minimize rendering jank.
- **NEVER use smooth rotation without a vignette (comfort mask)** — Smooth rotation causes motion sickness. Always provide snap turning OR dynamic vignetting.
- **NEVER force 3D MSAA if Foveated Rendering is enabled** — Foveation can conflict with MSAA natively in the OpenXR pipeline on some hardware.

### Locomotion & Interaction
- **NEVER skip a teleport locomotion option** — Smooth movement is intolerable for many. Always offer teleportation as an accessibility alternative.
- **NEVER use billboarding for VR UI** — `BILLBOARD_ENABLED` breaks stereoscopic depth cues. Use static `MeshInstance3D` planes with `SubViewports`.
- **NEVER place UI too close or too far** — 0.5m causes eye strain; 10m is unreadable. Optimal distance is 1-3 meters from the player.

### Safety & System
- **NEVER forget to respect physical play area boundaries** — Stepping into real-world objects is a safety risk. Use `XRServer` to fetch guardian bounds.
- **NEVER ignore focus_lost or session_ended signals** — Gracefully handle disconnections or system menu overlays by pausing the simulation.
- **NEVER hardcode XRControllerTracker names** — Use the **OpenXR Action Map** system to decouple gameplay from specific hardware labels.

## Comfort Decision Tree (start here)

1. **Can the player opt out of continuous locomotion?** → If no, stop and add teleport + seated mode before any smooth locomotion code.
2. **Turning:** snap turn default → load [vr_locomotion_handler.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_locomotion_handler.gd). Smooth turn only with vignette + comfort toggle.
3. **Play area / focus:** load [vr_safety_guardian_warner.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_safety_guardian_warner.gd) + [vr_headset_focus_guard.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_headset_focus_guard.gd) before shipping any locomotion.
4. **Session bootstrap / actions / FPS:** then load [vr_openxr_initializer.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_openxr_initializer.gd), [vr_input_action_mapper.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_input_action_mapper.gd), [vr_performance_config.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_performance_config.gd).

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: After the comfort decision tree, read the matching script before implementing that pattern. Do not invent a bare `use_xr = true` / `XRController3D.is_button_pressed` demo — start from the scripts below.

## Teleport Accessibility Path

Always ship teleport (or room-scale only) as an alternative to smooth locomotion.

1. **MANDATORY read** [vr_locomotion_handler.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_locomotion_handler.gd) — `teleport_to(target_global)`.
2. **Raycast** from controller aim to floor/navmesh; pass the hit point into `teleport_to`.
3. **Failure modes (must handle):**
   - **Guardian clip** — reject targets outside play-area bounds; warn via [vr_safety_guardian_warner.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_safety_guardian_warner.gd).
   - **Focus pause** — never teleport while the tree is paused / headset focus lost; [vr_headset_focus_guard.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_headset_focus_guard.gd) owns pause/mute.
4. Pair teleport with snap turn + vignette from the same locomotion handler.

## Comfort Gates (NEVER-adjacent)

These are hard comfort gates, not soft preferences:

1. **90+ FPS** before any optional VFX — nausea risk outweighs polish.
2. **Teleport or snap-turn path** always available — never ship smooth-only locomotion.
3. **Guardian + focus handlers** live before first public playtest.
4. **UI at 1–3 m** on composition layers / static quads — never billboarded close-range HUD.

### Expert patterns (script pointers)

1. **Mixed-Reality passthrough (Quest 3)** — `environment_blend_mode = ALPHA_BLEND` + `transparent_bg` exposes the camera feed through scene alpha → [mixed_reality_manager.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_mixed_reality_manager.gd) / [vr_passthrough_manager.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_passthrough_manager.gd).
2. **Composition-layer UI** — `OpenXRCompositionLayerQuad` + `SubViewport` bypasses lens blur → [xr_performance_overlay.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_xr_performance_overlay.gd).
3. **Universal grab** — OpenXR action map + central reparent manager → [universal_grab_manager.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_universal_grab_manager.gd) + [vr_input_action_mapper.gd](../scripts/platform_vr_vr_input_action_mapper.gd).
