description: "Expert blueprint for digital card games (CCG/Deckbuilders) including card data structures (Resource-based), deck management (draw/discard/reshuffle), turn logic, hand layout (arcing), drag-and-drop UI, effect resolution (Command pattern), and visual polish (godot-tweening, shaders). Use for CCG, deckbuilders, or tactical card games. Trigger keywords: card_game, deck_manager, card_data, hand_layout, drag_drop_cards, effect_resolution, command_pattern, draw_pile, discard_pile."

## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Logic & Architecture
- NEVER hardcode card logic inside UI scripts; strictly encapsulate gameplay effects in **`Callable` objects** or **Command resources** pushed to a LIFO stack.
- NEVER perform board-state calculations (Power/Toughness) in `_process()`; strictly use **Signal-driven triggers** or a centralized `EffectStack` resolver.
- NEVER forget **LIFO Stack Resolution**; strictly use **`Array.push_back()`** and **`Array.pop_back()`** to resolve reactions from top-to-bottom.

### UX & Animation
- NEVER skip **Z-Index management** during drag-and-drop; strictly raise the card to the front on click to prevent it sliding under other cards.
- NEVER allow instant card "teleportation" between piles; strictly use **`create_tween()`** / **`tween_property`** chains (0.2s+) for pile moves.
- NEVER use `global_position` for cards in hand; strictly position them using a **`Curve2D`** layout with **`sample_baked()`** for smooth arcs.

### Deck & State Management
- NEVER forget to handle **Empty Deck** scenarios; strictly implement auto-reshuffle of the discard pile to prevent soft-locks.
- NEVER use floating point numbers for discrete card stats; strictly use `int` for Costs, Attack, and Health to avoid precision drift.
- NEVER use standard Control nodes for mass tokens/battlefields; strictly use **`_draw()` custom drawing** to bypass SceneTree overhead when rendering 100+ cards or map icons.
- NEVER rely on SceneTree order for hand logic; strictly manage logical order in an **Array** and update visuals via **`queue_redraw()`**.
- NEVER erase array elements during a standard `for` loop; strictly iterate in reverse or use `filter()` to avoid indexing errors.
- NEVER forget to provide parameterless constructors in `_init()`; otherwise, Resources will fail to load in the Inspector.

## Core Loop
1. **Draw** → 2. **Evaluate** → 3. **Play** → 4. **Resolve (LIFO stack)** → 5. **Discard/End**

## Decision Trees

### Effect stack
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Nested reactions / counters | **MANDATORY** [card_effect_resolution.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_effect_resolution.gd) — **LIFO only** (`pop_back`) |
| FIFO sequential animations only | Rare; keep a separate queue — do **not** reuse the reaction stack |

### Hand & board
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Arc hand layout | `Curve2D.sample_baked` + [card_tween_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_tween_manager.gd) |
| Drag targeting | [card_drag_drop.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_drag_drop.gd) |
| Dense boards (100+ icons) | `_draw()` / [board_state_dictionary.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_board_state_dictionary.gd) — not Control-per-token |

### Data
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Card definitions | **MANDATORY** [card_data_resource.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_data_resource.gd) (parameterless `_init`) |
| Deck RNG | [deck_shuffle_bag.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_deck_shuffle_bag.gd) |
| Turn phases | [turn_state_machine.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_turn_state_machine.gd) |

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Data | `resources`, `custom-resources` | Card properties (Cost, Type, Effect) |
| 2. UI | `control-nodes`, `layout-containers` | Hand layout, tooltips |
| 3. Input | `drag-and-drop`, `state-machines` | Targeting, hovering |
| 4. Logic | `command-pattern`, `signals` | LIFO stack, turn phases |
| 5. Polish | `godot-tweening`, `shaders` | Draw juice, foils |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| FIFO `pop_front` on reaction stack | Use LIFO `pop_back` in [card_effect_resolution.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_effect_resolution.gd) |
| Instant pile snaps | Tween via [card_tween_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_card_game_card_tween_manager.gd) |
| Float ATK/HP | Use `int` stats on Resources |

## Elite notes (optional polish)
- Holographic foil: UV scroll shader on card Control — not required for stack correctness.
- Card history: signal bus logger for replay/debug; keep off the hot resolve path.
