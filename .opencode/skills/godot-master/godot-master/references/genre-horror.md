## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Atmosphere & Tension
- NEVER maintain 100% tension at all times; strictly use a **Sawtooth Pacing** model (buildup → peak/scare → dedicated relief period) to prevent player "numbing" and exhaustion.
- NEVER rely on jump-scares as the primary source of horror; focus on atmosphere, spatial audio cues, and the *anticipation* of a threat to build genuine dread.
- NEVER make environments pitch black to the point of frustrating navigation; darkness should obscure *threats* (details), not the *floor*. Use rim lighting or a limited-battery flashlight.
- NEVER grant the player unlimited resources; survival horror relies on **Scarcity**. Limited battery, rare ammo, and slow animations are mandatory to force stressful decision-making.

### AI & Senses
- NEVER allow AI to detect the player instantly; implement a **Suspicion Meter** or a 1-3s reaction window before the AI enters full aggression to avoid "unfair cheating" feel.
- NEVER use predictable AI paths; an enemy on a perfect loop is a puzzle, not a predator. Use the **Director** to periodically "hint" a new destination near the player.
- NEVER use Area3D overlap signals for instant, frame-perfect Line-of-Sight (LoS) checks; use nodeless raycasting via `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray()` for fixed-physics sync.
- NEVER calculate complex AI vision or pathfinding for monsters far outside the camera's frustum; use `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` to disable processing logic.
- NEVER leave navigation avoidance layers unconfigured on chasing monsters; explicitly assign avoidance masks to prevent visual "stacking" in tight corridors.

### Technical & Scarcity
- NEVER use the visual SceneTree (like GridContainer children) as the source of truth for inventory; strictly maintain a typed memory structure like `Dictionary[StringName, Resource]`.
- NEVER rely on instantiating standard Nodes to store base item stats/definitions; use custom `Resource` scripts to reduce memory overhead and allow direct Inspector editing.
- NEVER forget to call `duplicate(true)` on an item's Resource when adding to inventory; if items have mutable states (ammo/durability), you will overwrite the global resource otherwise.
- NEVER parse massive JSON save files synchronously; strictly offload heavy parsing to the `WorkerThreadPool` to prevent auto-save freezes.
- NEVER use standard strings for hot-path IDs (states, item types); strictly use `StringName` (&"chasing") for pointer-speed comparisons.
- NEVER evaluate exact floating-point equality (sanity == 0.0); strictly use `is_equal_approx()` or threshold checks for deterministic triggers.
- NEVER write screen-reading shaders expecting Godot 3 `SCREEN_TEXTURE`; strictly use `sampler2D` with `hint_screen_texture`.
- NEVER instantiate detailed monster meshes or lights without culling; strictly configure `visibility_range` for automatic HLOD efficiency.
- NEVER rely on AnimationPlayer for random flickering; use `Tween` for programmatic, clean energy manipulation.
- NEVER load heavy scare scenes or 4K textures synchronously via `load()`; strictly use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` to prevent frame stalls.
- NEVER scale CollisionShape3D non-uniformly; strictly adjust internal shape resource parameters (radius, height) to prevent erratic physics.
- NEVER perform synchronous, heavy file I/O in a Safe Room; strictly use **`Thread` and `Mutex`** to handle background saving without stalling the main game thread.
- NEVER check for hiding spot types by casting; strictly use **`Object` metadata (`set_meta`)** for performant, decoupled AI queries.

## Core Loop
1.  **Explore**: Player navigates a threatening environment.
2.  **Sense**: Player hears/sees signs of danger.
3.  **React**: Player hides, runs, or fights (disempowered combat).
4.  **Survive**: Player reaches safety or solves a puzzle.
5.  **Relief**: Brief moment of calm before tension builds again.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. The Director System (Macro AI)
Controls pacing so players never stay at 100% tension.

> **MANDATORY read**: [director_pacing.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_director_pacing.gd) — do not paste a one-off tension enum. Wire Director events to *near-player* investigation targets, never instant on-player teleports during quiet phases.

### 2. Sensory Perception (Micro AI)
Honest monster senses (vision + sound) that the Director may only *hint*, never hard-cheat.

> **MANDATORY reads**: [predator_stalking_ai.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_predator_stalking_ai.gd) for dual-brain orchestration; [monster_los_check.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_monster_los_check.gd) + [spatial_noise_emitter.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_spatial_noise_emitter.gd) for LoS/sound. Prefer `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray()` over Area overlap for vision.

### 3. Sanity / Stress System
Distorting the world based on fear.

> Load [sanity_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_sanity_manager.gd) + [sanity_shader_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_sanity_shader_manager.gd) for value → shake/bus/shader pipelines. Keep thresholds on `is_equal_approx` / bands, never `sanity == 0.0`.

## Key Mechanics Implementation

### Pacing (The Sawtooth Wave)
Horror needs peaks and valleys.
1.  **Safety**: Save room.
2.  **Unease**: Strange noise, lights flicker.
3.  **Dread**: Monster is known to be close.
4.  **Terror**: Chase sequence / Combat.
5.  **Relief**: Escape to Safety.

### The "Dual Brain" AI
*   **Director (All-knowing)**: Cheats to keep the alien relevant (teleports it closer if far away, guides it to player's general area).
*   **Alien (Senses only)**: Honest AI. Must actually see/hear the player to attack.

### 3. Hiding-Spot Metadata System
Use `set_meta` / groups — **MANDATORY**: [predator_stalking_ai.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_predator_stalking_ai.gd) + peer [godot-genre-stealth](genre-stealth.md). Do not paste hiding-spot tutorials inline.

### 4. Adaptive Audio (Stress Muffling)
Bus LPF / volume from fear — **MANDATORY**: [sanity_manager.gd](../scripts/genre_horror_sanity_manager.gd) + peer [godot-audio-systems](audio-systems.md).

### 5. Safe-Room Multithreaded Save
Threaded checkpoint I/O — **MANDATORY**: peer [godot-save-load-systems](save-load-systems.md) (Thread/Mutex / WorkerThreadPool). Never sync `FileAccess` on the main thread in a safe room.
