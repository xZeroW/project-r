## Architecture Decision: Where Does the Manager Live?

| Scope | Policy | Script |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Per character / enemy / turret | **Scene-scoped manager as child** (default) | [ability_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_manager.gd) or composition [ability_container.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_container.gd) on the entity |
| Shared unlock / loadout catalog across scenes | Autoload **catalog / progression only** (ranks, unlock flags) — not live cast state | Thin Autoload data; casts still go through the entity manager |
| Global "cast any ability anywhere" Autoload | **Avoid** | Breaks encapsulation and multiplayer authority |

**Resolved policy:** Live cooldowns, GCD, and `execute()` run on a **scene-scoped** AbilityManager / AbilityContainer under the caster. Autoloads may store unlock ranks; they must not be the combat cast oracle. Skill-tree UI reads/writes progression data, then calls into the caster’s manager — never `/root/AbilityManager.use_*` for combat.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER tick cooldowns / status durations in `_process()`** — Use `_physics_process(delta)` or one-shot Timers so cooldowns stay deterministic under frame spikes.
- **NEVER forget global cooldown (GCD)** when design needs anti-spam — Small shared lock (0.5–1.5s) between casts when required.
- **NEVER hardcode ability effects in the manager** — Strategy: each ability is a Resource / node with `execute()` ([ability_resource.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_resource.gd)).
- **NEVER allow casts during animation lock** — Gate on `is_casting` / anim signals.
- **NEVER save remaining cooldown floats without time normalization** — Persist absolute end timestamps (`Time.get_unix_time_from_system() + remaining`).
- **NEVER put live combat cast state in a global Autoload** — Scene-scoped manager (see decision table). Progression Autoloads are fine.
- **NEVER blindly ban or blindly require object pools** — GDScript refcounting makes pool-optional for light VFX; **do** pool when spawn/despawn of projectiles/AoE is high-frequency or allocation shows up in the profiler. Prefer instantiate/`queue_free` until measured otherwise.
- **NEVER grow deep ability inheritance trees** — Compose Resources + containers ([godot-composition](composition.md)).

## Golden Path (MANDATORY)

1. [ability_resource.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_resource.gd) — data + virtual `execute()`
2. [ability_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_manager.gd) **or** [ability_container.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_container.gd) — scene-scoped cast/cooldown
3. [buff_stat.gd](../scripts/ability_system_buff_stat.gd) — when buffs/modifiers exist
4. Damage resolution → [godot-combat-system](combat-system.md)

**Do NOT** paste inline AbilityManager / ComboSystem / SkillTreeManager novels into scenes. Skill trees are progression UI + prerequisite graphs that grant Resources to the caster’s container.

## Available Scripts

- [ability_resource.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_resource.gd) — **MANDATORY** before new abilities
- [ability_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_manager.gd) — **MANDATORY** Resource-driven cooldown registry (scene-scoped)
- [ability_container.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_container.gd) — **MANDATORY** alternative: node/Timer composition per ability
- [buff_stat.gd](../scripts/ability_system_buff_stat.gd) — modular buff stats (Do NOT Load if no buffs)
- [combo_tracker.gd](../scripts/ability_system_combo_tracker.gd) — windowed combo chains → finisher abilities
- [charge_ability.gd](../scripts/ability_system_charge_ability.gd) — multi-charge recharge (Flash-style)
- [skill_node.gd](../scripts/ability_system_skill_node.gd) / [skill_tree_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_skill_tree_manager.gd) — prerequisite graphs + point spend (progression only)
- [status_effect.gd](../scripts/ability_system_status_effect.gd) / [status_effect_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_status_effect_manager.gd) — ticking DoTs/buffs (`duplicate(true)` required)
- [ability_caster_network.gd](../scripts/ability_system_ability_caster_network.gd) — predict locally, authority validates RPC shell

## Cooldown & Status Timing Contract

- Cooldown registry updates and status `process_tick` must use **physics-frame** delta (`_physics_process`) or `Timer` nodes owned by the container.
- Hit detection from abilities stays on the physics tick when applying impulses / queries.
- UI may read cooldown progress in `_process`; it must not own the truth.

## Expert Techniques (short)

- **Dependency injection:** parents inject caster context; abilities do not `get_node("/root/Player")`.
- **Duck-typed hits:** `has_method(&"take_damage")` / combat DamageData — see combat skill.
- **AoE:** `call_group` or space queries; do not scan the whole tree each cast.
- **Networking:** predict locally, authority validates `can_use` + costs ([godot-multiplayer-networking](multiplayer-networking.md)).
- **Skill-tree visualizer:** `@tool` GraphEdit for design-time graphs; runtime still grants Resources to scene managers.

## Status Effects & Combos (critical WHY)

> **CAUTION:** Status/buff templates applied at runtime **must** use `duplicate(true)`. One poisoned `.tres` mutates every character sharing that asset — see [status_effect_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_status_effect_manager.gd).

- **Combos:** [combo_tracker.gd](../scripts/ability_system_combo_tracker.gd) — sequence window + recipe table; finishers remain normal `AbilityResource` entries.
- **Charges:** [charge_ability.gd](../scripts/ability_system_charge_ability.gd) — recharge ticks belong on `_physics_process`, not UI `_process`.
- **Skill trees:** [skill_tree_manager.gd](../scripts/ability_system_skill_tree_manager.gd) grants abilities to the **caster's** scene manager — progression Autoloads hold ranks only.
- **Save cooldowns:** persist **absolute end timestamps** (`Time.get_unix_time_from_system() + remaining`), not raw remaining floats — prevents clock/load exploits.

> **MANDATORY** for combos/charges/skill-tree/status/network depth beyond bullets above: [elite-ability-patterns.md](ability-system-elite-ability-patterns.md). **Do NOT Load** for a first AbilityResource + AbilityManager pass.

### Official Documentation
- [Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html) — Ability definitions, buffs, and status effects should be `Resource` data (not hardcoded manager switches) so designers can author and share assets.
- [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html) — Use `duplicate(true)` when applying a status/buff template at runtime so one character’s ticking state cannot mutate the shared `.tres` for everyone.
- [GDScript exports](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.html) — `@export` / `@export_group` power Inspector-tuned costs, cooldowns, prerequisites, and effect arrays on ability Resources.
- [Using signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html) — Emit `ability_cast`, `ability_ready`, and cooldown lifecycle signals so UI and VFX subscribe without coupling to AbilityManager internals.
- [Scene organization](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/scene_organization.html) — Keep “signals up, calls down”: parents/UI listen; managers call into ability Resources/nodes rather than reaching globally for combat state.
- [Idle and Physics Processing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/idle_and_physics_processing.html) — Tick cooldowns and GCD in `_physics_process` (fixed delta); avoid `_process` for cooldown math that desyncs under frame spikes.
- [Timer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_timer.html) — One-shot `Timer` children are a clean composition pattern for per-ability cooldowns in container-style managers.
- [SceneTreeTimer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenetreetimer.html) — `create_timer()` / await patterns fit cast times and short buff durations without adding persistent Timer nodes for every cast.
- [Groups](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/groups.html) — AoE abilities should `call_group` (or query groups) instead of hand-rolled scene scans for every hit target.
- [Time](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_time.html) — Persist cooldown *end* timestamps (`get_unix_time_from_system()` + remaining), not raw remaining floats, across save/load.
- [Saving games](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/saving_games.html) — Serialize ability unlock ranks and absolute cooldown end times with the rest of player progression data.
- [High-level multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html) — Authoritative cast validation + `@rpc` confirmation/cancel is the engine baseline for predicted ability casts.
