## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Design & Player Experience
- NEVER punish experimentation; strictly provide **Undo/Reset** functionality to allow risk-free hypothesis testing.
- NEVER require pixel-perfect input for logic puzzles; strictly use **Grid Snapping** or large, forgiving hitboxes.
- NEVER allow undetected **Soft-Locks** (unsolvable states); strictly notify the player or provide immediate backtracking.
- NEVER hide the rules of the world; strictly ensure visual feedback is instant and unambiguous (e.g., powered wires must glow).
- NEVER skip the **Non-Verbal Tutorial** phase; strictly introduce mechanics in isolation before combining them.

### Grid Logic & State
- NEVER use floating-point numbers (`Vector2`) for grid coordinates; strictly use **Vector2i** to prevent precision drift.
- NEVER use `_process()` for grid-state or win-condition validation; strictly trigger checks only when a piece moves.
- NEVER rely on the `SceneTree` structure as the source of truth; strictly maintain grid data in a separate script/dictionary.
- NEVER modify a Dictionary or Array size while iterating over it; strictly use a copy or a separate queue for modifications.
- NEVER calculate heavy recursive solvers in `_process()`; strictly cache results or use threaded workers for solve-checks.
- NEVER ignore diagonal rules in pathfinding; strictly configure `AStarGrid2D.diagonal_mode` correctly.

### Architecture & Performance
- NEVER ship dual undo authorities; strictly use Godot's built-in **UndoRedo** via [puzzle_undo_manager.gd](scripts/puzzle_undo_manager.gd) — do **not** also maintain a hand-rolled Command stack.
- NEVER intermingle "do" and "undo" logic in the same function; strictly maintain separation for predictable rollbacks.
- NEVER use exact floating-point equality (==); strictly use `is_equal_approx()` for spatial constraints.
- NEVER use `load()` for resetting large rooms dynamically; strictly use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()`.
- NEVER leave **Tween** objects unreferenced; strictly kill active tweens before starting new movement on the same object.

> **MANDATORY reads** before implementing the matching system:
> 1. [puzzle_undo_manager.gd](scripts/puzzle_undo_manager.gd) — sole undo authority (`UndoRedo`)
> 2. [grid_manager.gd](scripts/grid_manager.gd) — Vector2i grid as truth
> 3. [puzzle_state_validator.gd](scripts/puzzle_state_validator.gd) — soft-lock / win checks on commit

### Original Expert Patterns

## Core Loop
1. **Observe** → 2. **Hypothesize** → 3. **Commit move** → 4. **Validate** → 5. **Undo/Reset** if needed

## Decision Trees

### Genre → scripts
| Puzzle type | MANDATORY reads |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Sokoban / push grid | [grid_manager.gd](scripts/grid_manager.gd), [grid_tween_mover.gd](scripts/grid_tween_mover.gd), [puzzle_undo_manager.gd](scripts/puzzle_undo_manager.gd), [puzzle_state_validator.gd](scripts/puzzle_state_validator.gd) |
| Match-3 | [match_three_logic.gd](scripts/match_three_logic.gd), [grid_tween_mover.gd](scripts/grid_tween_mover.gd), [puzzle_undo_manager.gd](scripts/puzzle_undo_manager.gd) |
| Physics / spatial | Snap on settle → then same undo/validator path; do not treat rigid bodies as truth |
| Hints / solvers | [puzzle_pathfinder.gd](scripts/puzzle_pathfinder.gd) (`AStarGrid2D.diagonal_mode`) |

### Undo authority
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| Player undo/redo | **Only** [puzzle_undo_manager.gd](scripts/puzzle_undo_manager.gd) |
| Level editor history | Still `UndoRedo` — wrap editor actions the same way |

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Data | `dictionaries`, `resources` | Grid truth, level `.tres` |
| 2. Input | `godot-input-handling` | Snapped moves |
| 3. Motion | `godot-tweening` | Piece Tweens |
| 4. AI/hints | `godot-navigation-pathfinding` | A* hints |
| 5. Persist | `godot-save-load-systems` | Level / progress |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Dual undo APIs | Delete Command-stack path; use UndoRedo manager only |
| Win check in `_process` | Validate on move commit via state validator |
| Float grid coords | `Vector2i` only |

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [puzzle-elite-implementations.md](references/puzzle-elite-implementations.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Command Pattern (Undo System)
Essential for puzzle games. Never punish testing.

```gdscript

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **Tweens**: Use `create_tween()` for all grid movements. It feels much better than instant snapping.
*   **Custom Resources**: Store level data (layout, starting positions) in `.tres` files for easy editing in the Inspector.
*   **Signals**: Use signals like `state_changed` to update UI/Visuals decoupled from the logic.
