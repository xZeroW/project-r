## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Generation & RNG
- NEVER make runs dependent on pure RNG; strictly provide **mitigation** (rerolls, shops, pity timers) to ensure every run is winnable.
- NEVER use unseeded RNG for world generation; strictly initialize isolated `RandomNumberGenerator` with a predictable seed for daily runs/debugging.
- NEVER rely on `@GlobalScope.randi()` for critical logic; strictly use local RNG instances to prevent global state pollution.
- NEVER use `Array.pick_random()` for critical content drops; strictly use a **Shuffle Bag** to prevent statistically unfair streaks.
- NEVER generate massive dungeons on the main thread; strictly use **`WorkerThreadPool.add_task()`** or **`add_group_task()`** to distribute generation across cores and prevent frame freezes.
- NEVER interact with the SceneTree from a background thread; strictly generate dungeon data in a **thread-safe Array/PackedByteArray** before parsing on the main thread.

### Data & State
- NEVER allow **Save Scumming**; strictly delete mid-run save files immediately upon loading to enforce permadeath.
- NEVER allow the player to see the "Edge of the World"; strictly use **Fog of War** or limited vision cones to maintain the mystery of the unknown.
- NEVER evaluate complex "Director" heuristics every frame; strictly use **Frame-Slicing (`Engine.get_process_frames()`)** to run heavy pacing logic only once every 60-120 frames for CPU efficiency.
- NEVER move rooms individually by pixel values during procedural generation; strictly use **`Marker2D` Connection Points** in pre-authored scenes to calculate exact offsets for seamless room stitching.
- NEVER allow Run State to leak into Meta State; strictly use separate singletons or Resources for `RunManager` and `MetaManager`.
- NEVER scale meta-progression to be overpowered (+100% damage); strictly keep upgrades subtle (+5-15%) to maintain skill-based play.
- NEVER forget to call `duplicate(true)` on base stat Resources; failing to deep-duplicate causes all entities to share a single health instance.
- NEVER save run states to `.tscn` files; strictly serialize to JSON or binary in `user://` to prevent bloat.
- NEVER rely on the `SceneTree` as the source of truth for grid logic; strictly maintain grid data in a separate Dictionary or Array.

### Grid & Performance
- NEVER forget to handle **Navigation re-baking**; strictly rebake `NavigationRegion2D` AFTER procedural tiles are placed.
- NEVER use AStar2D for tile grids; strictly use **`AStarGrid2D`** with **`jumping_enabled = true`** (Jump Point Search) for O(1) queries and high-performance pathing across open areas.
- NEVER forget to call `update()` on `AStarGrid2D` after modifying states; strictly ensures pathfinding queries aren't stale.
- NEVER use floats (`Vector2`) for discrete grid coordinates; strictly use **Vector2i** to prevent precision drift.
- NEVER use Manhattan heuristics for 8-way movement; strictly use **`HEURISTIC_CHEBYSHEV`** or **`HEURISTIC_OCTILE`**.
- NEVER iterate over every cell coordinate (0 to W,H) in GDScript; strictly use `get_used_cells()` for optimized tile access.
- NEVER clear procedural levels using `free()`; strictly use `queue_free()` to avoid mid-frame segmentation faults.
- NEVER broadcast mass state changes to a grid immediately; strictly use `call_deferred()` or **`call_group_flags`** to avoid frame spikes during turn transitions.
- NEVER use heavy TileMapLayer nodes for high-resolution Fog of War; strictly use a **GPU Shader Mask** via `ColorRect` and an `ImageTexture` updated via **`RenderingServer.texture_2d_update()`**.

## Core Loop
1.  **Preparation**: Select character, equip meta-upgrades (see `meta_progression_resource.gd`).
2.  **The Run**: complete procedural levels (`dungeon_generator_walker.gd`), acquire temporary power-ups.
3.  **The Challenge**: Survive increasingly difficult encounters using A* pathfinding (`astar_grid_handler.gd`).
4.  **Death/Victory**: Run ends, resources calculated.
5.  **Meta-Progression**: Spend resources on permanent unlocks (`meta_progression_resource.gd`).
6.  **Repeat**: Start a new run with new capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

Roguelikes require a strict separation between **Run State** (temporary) and **Meta State** (persistent).

- **Run lifespan / seed**: Own an AutoLoad that resets on death; seed via **MANDATORY** [seeded_rng_resource.gd](scripts/seeded_rng_resource.gd). Never leak run HP/gold into meta saves.
- **Meta unlocks**: **MANDATORY** [meta_progression_manager.gd](scripts/meta_progression_manager.gd) + [meta_progression_resource.gd](scripts/meta_progression_resource.gd) — subtle permanent bonuses only (+5–15%).
- **Serialize**: Prefer [json_state_serializer.gd](scripts/json_state_serializer.gd) / `user://` JSON-binary; never treat `.tscn` as a run save.

## Key Mechanics (route to scripts/)

### Procedural Dungeon Generation
- **Drunkard's Walk**: **MANDATORY** [dungeon_generator_walker.gd](scripts/dungeon_generator_walker.gd) — pass a local seeded `RandomNumberGenerator`; directions via `rng.randi() % directions.size()` (never `Array.pick_random()`).
- **Critical drops / fairness**: Use Shuffle Bag patterns in [roguelike_patterns.gd](scripts/roguelike_patterns.gd) or weights in [weighted_loot_table.gd](scripts/weighted_loot_table.gd).
- **BSP / room orchestrator**: [dungeon_generator.gd](scripts/dungeon_generator.gd); deeper WFC/noise → peer `godot-procedural-generation`.
- **Pathing after gen**: [astar_grid_handler.gd](scripts/astar_grid_handler.gd) — call `update()` after solid-cell edits; rebake `NavigationRegion2D` if using nav meshes.

### Relics, turns, fog, pacing
- Relic hooks / synergy tags: Resource subclasses + [weighted_loot_table.gd](scripts/weighted_loot_table.gd); inventory peer `godot-inventory-system`.
- Turns: [turn_manager_decoupled.gd](scripts/turn_manager_decoupled.gd) + [move_command_object.gd](scripts/move_command_object.gd).
- Fog / LOS: [fog_of_war_masker.gd](scripts/fog_of_war_masker.gd), [fov_raycast_calculator.gd](scripts/fov_raycast_calculator.gd).
- Director pacing: frame-slice with `Engine.get_process_frames() % N` (see NEVER); keep heuristics out of every-frame `_process` work.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **RNG Dependency**: Don't make runs entirely dependent on luck. Good roguelikes allow skill to mitigate bad RNG.
2.  **Meta-progression Imbalance**: If meta-upgrades are too strong, the game becomes a "grind to win" rather than "learn to win".
3.  **Lack of Variety**: Procedural generation is only as good as the content it arranges. You need *a lot* of content (rooms, enemies, items) to keep it fresh.
4.  **Save Scumming**: Players will try to quit to avoid death. Save the state only on floor transition or quit, and delete the save on load (optional, but standard for strict roguelikes).

## Godot-Specific Tips

-   **Seeded Runs**: Always initialize `RandomNumberGenerator` with a seed. This allows players to share specific run layouts.
-   **ResourceSaver**: Use `ResourceSaver` for meta-progression, but be careful with cyclical references in deeply nested resources.
-   **Scenes as Rooms**: Build your "rooms" as separate scenes (`Room1.tscn`, `Room2.tscn`) and instance them into the generated layout for handcrafted quality within procedural layouts.
-   **Navigation**: Rebake `NavigationRegion2D` at runtime after generating the dungeon layout if using 2D navigation.

## Advanced Techniques

-   **Synergy System**: Tag items (`fire`, `projectile`, `companion`) and check for tag combinations to create emergent power-ups.
-   **Director AI**: An invisible "Director" system that tracks player health/stress and adjusts spawn rates dynamically (like *Left 4 Dead*).
