## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Networking & Scale
- NEVER sync all 100 players every frame; strictly use a **Relevancy System** to sync high-freq data only for players within ~100m. Far players sync at ~5Hz.
- NEVER use `TRANSFER_MODE_RELIABLE` for movement data; strictly use **Unreliable** to prevent packet backup and network congestion.
- NEVER focus on client-side hit detection; strictly use **Authoritative Server Validation** where the server confirms "Did it hit?" based on state history.
- NEVER trust the client for game state; strictly validate all movement, looting, and inventory changes exclusively on the authoritative server.
- NEVER run a dedicated server with visuals; strictly use **Headless Mode** (`--headless`) or dummy drivers to save massive CPU/GPU resources.
- NEVER call RPCs before connection; strictly wait for the `connected_to_server` signal before attempting synchronization logic.

### Mechanics & Performance
- NEVER pick a fully random center for the Safe Zone; strictly target centers that ensure the new circle is **completely contained** within the current one.
- NEVER allow "Storm Tunneling"; strictly use a **Distance-to-Center** calculation rather than a simple collision perimeter to prevent skips at low tick rates.
- NEVER spawn loot without **Object Pooling**; strictly pre-instantiate and toggle visibility/collision to avoid GC spikes during dense spawns.
- NEVER ignore `VisibilityNotifier3D`; strictly disable `AnimationPlayer`, `_process()`, and heavy AI logic for players that are not visible to the observer.
- NEVER print in tight server loops; strictly avoid `print()` as console I/O is blocking and will tank server performance in high-player-count matches.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.

### Zone / Storm
### [storm_system.gd](scripts/storm_system.gd)
**MANDATORY for any zone/storm work** — phase radii, contained next-center selection, distance-to-center damage (anti-tunneling). Do not paste inline zone_manager tutorials.

### Networking & Multiplayer
### [kill_feed_bus.gd](scripts/kill_feed_bus.gd)
Global elimination signal bus with match stat tracking.

### [headless_branch_logic.gd](scripts/headless_branch_logic.gd)
Expert dedicated server initialization that branches logic based on `headless` execution and server-specific feature flags.

### [enet_br_server.gd](scripts/enet_br_server.gd)
High-player-capacity ENet server setup optimized for 100+ concurrent peers over UDP.

### [state_replication_unreliable.gd](scripts/state_replication_unreliable.gd)
Pattern for synchronizing player transforms via `TRANSFER_MODE_UNRELIABLE` to minimize network congestion in large matches.

### [authoritative_looting.gd](scripts/authoritative_looting.gd)
Authoritative server-side validation logic for preventing cheat-based item collection and infinite looting.

### [targeted_rpc_relay.gd](scripts/targeted_rpc_relay.gd)
Optimized communication pattern using `rpc_id()` to target specific peers and reduce wasted packet broadcasts.

### [server_state_buffer.gd](scripts/server_state_buffer.gd)
Handling network jitter and out-of-order UDP packets via sequential state buffering and tick-based sorting.

### Performance & Optimization
### [rid_loot_spawner.gd](scripts/rid_loot_spawner.gd)
Bypassing the node hierarchy for massive loot density. Uses `RenderingServer` directly to eliminate CPU overhead for item drops.

### [async_map_loader.gd](scripts/async_map_loader.gd)
Non-blocking map sector streaming using `ResourceLoader` background threads for seamless open-world exploration.

### [multimesh_vegetation.gd](scripts/multimesh_vegetation.gd)
Drawing dense foliage and environment assets (100k+ instances) via `MultiMeshInstance3D` to maximize rendering performance.

### [threaded_ai_manager.gd](scripts/threaded_ai_manager.gd)
Offloading server-side bot behavior and pathfinding logic to the `WorkerThreadPool` to prevent main-thread stalling.

### Restored from baseline
- [lag_compensator.gd](scripts/lag_compensator.gd) - Server transform history + hit timestamp rewind validation.
- [monster_synchronizer.gd](scripts/monster_synchronizer.gd) - `MultiplayerSynchronizer` delta/on-change replication setup.

## NEVER Do in Battle Royale

- **NEVER export mobile clients without the INTERNET permission** — Communication will silently fail on Android/iOS if the manifest is missing the networking permission.
- **NEVER use `get_var(true)` on untrusted data** — Deserializing arbitrary objects allows attackers to execute remote code on the server or other clients.
- **NEVER synchronize `Object` or `Resource` types over network** — Use the `MultiplayerSynchronizer` strictly for base types (int, float, vec).
- **NEVER assume `UNRELIABLE` packets arrive in order** — Design state interpolation carefully to handle missing or out-of-order ticks.
- **NEVER leave `multiplayer_poll` false without manual calling** — If using custom threads, failing to call `multiplayer.poll()` freezes all traffic.

## Advanced (keep elite, no deploy/loot re-tutorials)

### Lag Compensation
Server keeps transform history; validate client hit timestamps against rewound poses (authoritative). Pair with shooter/combat peers.

### Delta-Patching
`MultiplayerSynchronizer` + `REPLICATION_MODE_ON_CHANGE` for health/inventory; `ALWAYS` only for hot transforms. Cap with `delta_interval`.

### Zone Visualizer
Unshaded, `cull_disabled` spatial shader on inverted sphere scaled by [storm_system.gd](scripts/storm_system.gd).

## Common Pitfalls

1. Too much loot → pool + RID spawner
2. Camping → storm forces movement ([storm_system.gd](scripts/storm_system.gd))
3. Client hit authority → server validate with history
