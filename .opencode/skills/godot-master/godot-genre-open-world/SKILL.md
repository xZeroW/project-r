## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### World & Persistence
- NEVER prioritize Map Size over Density; empty landscapes are poor design. Strictly focus on **Points of Interest (POIs)** within every 30 seconds of travel.
- NEVER save the entire world state; strictly use **Delta Persistence** to record only unique changes (chopped trees, looted chests) to prevent massive save files.
- NEVER load large chunks or scenes synchronously; strictly use **`ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()`** to prevent "Loading Hitches" and frame freezes.
- NEVER manipulate the active SceneTree directly from a background thread; strictly use **`call_deferred()`** to safely apply background thread chunk instantiations back to the main thread.
- NEVER keep distant, unloaded chunks in memory; strictly `queue_free()` and nullify references to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes.
- NEVER bake massive collision into one mesh; strictly break the world into chunks with local collision regions for efficient physics queries.
- NEVER save high-volume entity states in text formats (.tscn/.json); strictly use **Binary Serialization** (`store_var`) for high-speed I/O.

### Physics & Performance
- NEVER ignore the "Floating Origin" jitter beyond 8,192 units; strictly implement a **World-Shift system** or enable **Large World Coordinates (Double Precision)** in project settings.
- NEVER process physics or AI at extreme distances; strictly use **Spatial Partitioning** to disable logic for entities in far-away, inactive chunks.
- NEVER calculate physics-sensitive state in `_process()`; strictly use `_physics_process()` for deterministic interaction at fluctuating framerates.
- NEVER spawn individual `MeshInstance3D` nodes for massive foliage; strictly use **MultiMeshInstance3D** to batch hundreds of thousands of meshes into a single GPU draw call.
- NEVER move `OccluderInstance3D` nodes at runtime; this forces a CPU BVH rebuild and causes severe micro-stuttering.
- NEVER leave `CSGShape3D` nodes active in exported builds; strictly bake them into static `ArrayMesh` geometry before shipping.
- NEVER compile complex shaders during gameplay; strictly perform "warm-up" during loading or enable project-wide caching.
- NEVER rely solely on automatic mesh decimation; strictly use **VisibilityRange (HLOD)** to substitute complex materials with cheap imposters or completely hide objects at extreme distances.

### Logic & Architecture
- NEVER perform global A* searches across the entire massive world; strictly use `NavigationPathQueryParameters3D` to limit pathfinding to localized active regions.
- NEVER use `find_child()` or deep tree iteration for global state (e.g., Time of Day); strictly use **Scene Groups** (`call_group()`) for optimized broadcasting.
- NEVER synchronize complex Resource types over the network; strictly serialize world changes into primitive Dictionaries or PackedByteArrays.
- NEVER spawn raw `Thread.new()` for chunk I/O when `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` already covers scene streaming — prefer ResourceLoader; custom threads only for non-Resource work with deferred SceneTree apply.

## Core Loop
Traverse → Discover POIs → Quest/travel → Persist deltas → Weather/day cycle immersion.

## Decision Tree: Streamer / Origin / HLOD

| Concern | Choose | Script |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Chunk load/unload around player | ResourceLoader threaded + deferred add_child | **MANDATORY** [world_streamer.gd](scripts/world_streamer.gd), [async_chunk_loader.gd](scripts/async_chunk_loader.gd) |
| Origin: gameplay entities in a group, custom shift policy | Group `"world_entities"` shift | [floating_origin_shifter.gd](scripts/floating_origin_shifter.gd) |
| Origin: single world_root + player warp + physics interp + shader offset | Root shifter | [world_origin_shifter.gd](scripts/world_origin_shifter.gd) |
| Origin: planetary / >~few×10k units, physics-heavy | **Large World Coordinates** (double-precision build) | Project setting — may still use a shifter for shader/audio sync |
| Distant mesh swap / impostor | VisibilityRange HLOD | **MANDATORY** [hlod_visibility_config.gd](scripts/hlod_visibility_config.gd) |
| Disable far AI/physics | Distance/chunk gate | [lod_logic_enabler.gd](scripts/lod_logic_enabler.gd) |
| Persist only changes | Binary delta | [binary_save_manager.gd](scripts/binary_save_manager.gd) |

**Pick one origin strategy** — do not dual-own `floating_origin_shifter` and `world_origin_shifter` on the same world root.

## Architecture (no duplicated Elite dumps)

1. **Streamer** — Active chunk set from player cell; unload with `queue_free`; load via threaded ResourceLoader; instantiate with `call_deferred`. Do not re-inline streamer pseudocode — read the MANDATORY scripts.
2. **Delta state** — Dictionary keyed by chunk id for dead entities / looted chests; write with binary saver when chunks unload.
3. **HLOD** — Proxy mesh `visibility_range_begin`; detail children use `visibility_parent` — configure via [hlod_visibility_config.gd](scripts/hlod_visibility_config.gd).
4. **POI / compass** — Density > size; angle map UI from player forward to POI; no need for a second floating-origin code block.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Empty world — density over km² vanity
2. Save bloat — delta-only persistence
3. Far physics — [lod_logic_enabler.gd](scripts/lod_logic_enabler.gd)
4. Phantom `hlod_configurator.gd` — does not exist; use [hlod_visibility_config.gd](scripts/hlod_visibility_config.gd)

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [open-world-elite-implementations.md](references/open-world-elite-implementations.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Godot-Specific Tips

- **VisibilityRange**: Use `visibility_range_begin` / `end` on MeshInstance3D for HLOD without a dedicated LOD node.
- **Threading**: Prefer `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` for chunks; custom `Thread` only when not loading Resources.
- **OcclusionCulling**: Bake occlusion for cities; open fields often need distance culling only.
