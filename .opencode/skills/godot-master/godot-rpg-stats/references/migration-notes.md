# Migration notes: godot-rpg-stats

Incremental upgrade for topics this skill covers. Apply **one hop**, stabilize/test, then next. Never skip hops.

If the project is **< 4.0**, follow [godot-version-migration](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-version-migration/SKILL.md) era bridges (legacy → 3→4) until 4.0, then these hops. Official 3→4: [Upgrading from Godot 3 to Godot 4](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.html).

## 4.0 → 4.1

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.1](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.1.html)

*No skill-relevant breaking changes for this hop.*

## 4.1 → 4.2

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.2](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.2.html)

*No skill-relevant breaking changes for this hop.*

## 4.2 → 4.3

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.3](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.3.html)

- Scripted Object / typed Array binary serialization changes — verify Resource round-trips.
- Large PackedByteArray storage format may not open in older editors.
- Re-test save formats after Object/Array serialization and PackedByteArray storage changes.

## 4.3 → 4.4

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.4](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.4.html)

- `@export_file` → `uid://` in Inspector-assigned values.
- `Curve` clamps to configured min/max.
- Encrypted FileAccess / store_* bool returns — handle failures; UID paths in exported files.

## 4.4 → 4.5

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.5](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.5.html)

- Resource deep-duplicate and UID export-file changes affect inventory/quest/economy Resource graphs.
- `Resource.duplicate(true)` no longer deep-copies external resources by default.
- Deep-duplicate semantics when cloning save-related Resources.

## 4.5 → 4.6

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.6](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.6.html)

- First save in 4.6 rewrites scenes with unique node IDs.
- Scene unique IDs change diffs — migrate save schemas if they keyed on old node identity assumptions.

## 4.6 → 4.7

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.7](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.7.html)

- Re-validate Resource pipelines after packed-array setter and typed-return GDScript changes.
