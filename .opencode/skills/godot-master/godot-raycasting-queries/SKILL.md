> - [query_exclusion_optimization.gd](scripts/query_exclusion_optimization.gd) — RID exclude lists so casters never self-hit.

## NEVER Do in Physics Queries

- **NEVER access `direct_space_state` outside of `_physics_process()`** — The physics space can be locked or running on a separate thread; querying it in `_process()` is unsafe [1, 2].
- **NEVER use ShapeCast when a thin RayCast is sufficient** — Volume queries are significantly more expensive. Default to rays unless you need volumetric detection [3, 4].
- **NEVER assume results return `CollisionObject` nodes** — CSG shapes, `GridMap`, and `TileMapLayer` return themselves, not a generic physics body [5, 6].
- **NEVER assume `RayCast` nodes update instantly** — They update once per physics frame. If you move a node and query it immediately, you MUST call `force_raycast_update()` [3, 9].
- **NEVER use complex visual meshes for physics queries** — GPU-only data requires expensive thread locking to parse. Use simplified primitive collision shapes [10, 11].
- **NEVER iterate results to find the first valid hit** — Use `collision_mask` and `collision_layer` to filter queries at the server level for maximum performance.
- **NEVER forget to exclude the caster** — A ray starting from the center of a character will hit the character itself. Use `query.exclude = [self.get_rid()]` [20].
- **NEVER use rays for small, fast detection areas** — Rays can "tunnel" through thin walls if the frame rate drops. Use `cast_motion` or high-frequency stepping for bullets.
- **NEVER query 1000+ rays individually in GDScript** — Batch your queries or use the `PhysicsServer` directly in C++ if you reach extreme query counts.
- **NEVER ignore the `result.rid`** — RIDs are the fastest way to identify and exclude objects in subsequent queries, bypassing node-path lookups [20].

## Query-Type Decision Table

Pick the cheapest API that answers the question. Always pair rays/shapes with RID exclude + masks ([query_exclusion_optimization.gd](scripts/query_exclusion_optimization.gd)).

| Need | Prefer | Cost | When | Script |
|------|--------|------|------|--------|
| Persistent sensor in the scene (ledge, aim assist debug) | `RayCast2D`/`RayCast3D` node | Low–med | Few casts; OK waiting one physics frame (or `force_raycast_update()`) | Scene node + NEVER rules |
| Hitscan / LOS / one-shot mid-frame ray | `PhysicsDirectSpaceState*.intersect_ray` | Low | High frequency, no permanent node | **MANDATORY** [direct_space_state_raycast.gd](scripts/direct_space_state_raycast.gd) |
| Footing, thick walls, melee volume | `ShapeCast*` / `intersect_shape` | Med–high | Thin ray tunnels or misses volume | **MANDATORY** [shapecast_ground_detection.gd](scripts/shapecast_ground_detection.gd) |
| Explosion / occupancy at a point | `intersect_point` | Low–med | Epicenter overlap list | [point_in_shape_query.gd](scripts/point_in_shape_query.gd) |
| Stuck / penetration resolve | `get_rest_info` | Med | Overlap recovery | [rest_info_3d_stuck_fix.gd](scripts/rest_info_3d_stuck_fix.gd) |
| Pierce / multi-hit along a line | Repeated `intersect_ray` + exclude RIDs | Med | Projectiles that keep going | [multiple_hit_piercing_ray.gd](scripts/multiple_hit_piercing_ray.gd) |
| Screen → world click | Camera project + `intersect_ray` | Low | Picking | [mouse_pick_3d_query.gd](scripts/mouse_pick_3d_query.gd) |

## 3D Mouse Picking Example

```gdscript
func screen_point_to_ray():
    var space_state = get_world_3d().direct_space_state
    var mouse_pos = get_viewport().get_mouse_position()
    
    var origin = project_ray_origin(mouse_pos)
    var end = origin + project_ray_normal(mouse_pos) * 2000
    
    var query = PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.create(origin, end)
    var result = space_state.intersect_ray(query)
    
    if result:
        return result.collider
    return null
```

## Expert WHY (query timing & LOS)

- **Physics step only** — `direct_space_state` in `_physics_process`, not `_process`.
- **Self-hit** — `query.exclude = [get_rid()]` on rays from character center.
- **NavMesh LOS** — physics ray ≠ carved nav hole; `path.size() == 2` on `NavigationServer3D.map_get_path` for strict mesh LOS (see deep dive).
- **Surface types** — `collider.get_meta(&"surface_type")` beats class/group checks for decals/footsteps.
- **Compute GPU rays** — out of scope; not a drop-in for gameplay `intersect_ray`.
