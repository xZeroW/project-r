## Architectural Thinking: The "Wave-State" Pattern

A Master implementation treats waves as **Data-Driven Transitions**. Instead of hardcoding spawn counts, use a `WaveResource` to define "Encounters" that the `WaveManager` processes sequentially.

### Core Responsibilities
- **Manager**: Orchestrates the timeline. Handles delays between waves and tracks "Victory" conditions (all enemies dead).
- **Spawner**: Decoupled nodes that provide spatial context for where enemies appear (`wave_spawner.gd` / `wave_weighted_spawner.gd`).
- **Resource**: Immutable data containers that allow designers to rebalance the game without touching code.

## Density Decision Tree (pick scale before coding)

| Live density | Approach | MANDATORY loads |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Under ~80 SceneTree enemies** | Node manager + Marker spawners | [wave_manager.gd](scripts/wave_manager.gd), [wave_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_spawner.gd), [wave_resource.gd](scripts/wave_resource.gd) |
| **Swarm visuals / hundreds** | MultiMesh + weighted composition | [wave_loop_patterns.gd](scripts/wave_loop_patterns.gd) (MultiMesh / async path), [wave_weighted_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_weighted_spawner.gd) |
| **~10k bodies** | PhysicsServer / NavigationServer RIDs (no per-mob Node) | [wave_loop_patterns.gd](scripts/wave_loop_patterns.gd) server-RID patterns; do **not** scale `wave_manager` node spawns |

`wave_manager.gd` is the SceneTree golden path (deferred `add_child`, group/signal clear counts, optional pool). Treat it as **prototype→mid-scale** — for RID swarms, follow `wave_loop_patterns.gd` instead of instantiating thousands of nodes.

## Composition Golden Path

1. Author a [wave_resource.gd](scripts/wave_resource.gd) composition table.
2. Place [wave_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_spawner.gd) Markers (or [wave_weighted_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_weighted_spawner.gd) when variety weights matter).
3. Point [wave_manager.gd](scripts/wave_manager.gd) `spawner` at that Marker; manager defers spawn and clears via `&"enemies"` group + signals.
4. When weights replace fixed counts, call `WaveWeightedSpawner.spawn_enemy()` from the composition loop (or set manager `spawner` to the weighted node).

## Expert Code Patterns

### 1. The Async Wave Trigger
Use `await` timers in [wave_manager.gd](scripts/wave_manager.gd) — **MANDATORY read** before writing a custom timeline. Spawns use `call_deferred(&"add_child", …)`; clear via signals/groups (not `get_children()` scans).

### 2. Composition-Based Spawning
Define variety in [wave_resource.gd](scripts/wave_resource.gd); place units with [wave_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_spawner.gd) / [wave_weighted_spawner.gd](scripts/wave_weighted_spawner.gd). Do not hardcode scene paths in the manager.

## Master Decision Matrix: Progression

| Pattern | Best For | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear** | Story missions | Hand-crafted list of `WaveResource`. |
| **Endless** | Survival modes | Code-generated `WaveResource` with multiplier math. |
| **Triggered** | RPG Encounters | Wave starts only when player enters an `Area3D`. |

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER iterate through get_children() to find all enemies** — This is extremely slow. Always add enemies to an "enemies" group and use `get_tree().get_nodes_in_group(&"enemies")` for efficient access.
- **NEVER constantly instantiate() and queue_free() hundreds of enemies** — This causes garbage collection stutters. Use an object pool to reuse existing enemy instances.
- **NEVER spawn thousands of separate MeshInstance3D nodes for swarms** — This will tank your draw calls. Use `MultiMeshInstance3D` to batch thousands of meshes into a single GPU call.
- **NEVER calculate pathfinding for hundreds of agents on the main thread** — This will freeze your game. Enable `use_async_iterations` on your navigation regions or use `NavigationServer3D.query_path()`.
- **NEVER forget to check is_inside_tree() before adding a child** — If the spawner is queued for deletion, adding a child will crash. Always verify the spawner is still active in the tree.
- **NEVER assign a preloaded resource (like stats.tres) directly to spawned mobs** — They will all share the exact same health/stats. Always call `base_stats.duplicate_deep()` to give each mob its own unique data.
- **NEVER use standard strings for high-frequency group calls** — Always use `StringName` (&"enemies", &"take_damage") for optimal hash performance and to avoid unnecessary string allocations.
- **NEVER spawn entities directly inside physics callbacks synchronously** — Instantiating nodes during physics steps can corrupt the physics state. Always use `call_deferred(&"add_child", enemy)`.
- **NEVER leave CollisionShapes on dead enemies active** — Corpses will block towers and navigation. Use `set_deferred("disabled", true)` immediately upon death.
- **NEVER synchronize complex Object types via MultiplayerSynchronizer** — It only supports primitive types. For complex data, sync a UID or ID and look up the data locally on the client.
- **NEVER auto-start waves without player feedback** — Always provide a UI countdown, a visual "Wave Incoming" effect, or a start button to maintain player agency.
- **NEVER hardcode spawn positions at (0,0,0)** — Use `Marker3D` nodes in the editor so you can visually adjust spawn points without digging into code.
- **NEVER check wave completion by counting children every frame** — It's too expensive. Maintain a local counter or use a signal-based system to track active enemy counts.
- **NEVER use the same navigation map for every entity type** — If you have flying and walking enemies, use separate navigation maps to prevent pathing issues.
- **NEVER scale collision shapes non-uniformly for spawners** — This breaks the collision detection math. Adjust the shape resource properties instead.

## Expert Wave Patterns

### 1. Occlusion Culling for Swarms
To optimize performance with hundreds of enemies, enable **Occlusion Culling**.
- **Setup**: Add an `OccluderInstance3D` to your arena and bake it.
- **Result**: Enemies completely hidden behind walls/pillars won't be processed by the GPU, significantly boosting FPS.

### 2. Wave UI Architecture
Decouple your wave data from the UI using a `CanvasLayer` and signals.
- **Wave Counter**: Display current/total waves.
- **Health Bars**: Use a `TextureProgressBar` on a `CanvasLayer` for bosses, or `Sprite3D` with a viewport texture for individual enemy health bars.
