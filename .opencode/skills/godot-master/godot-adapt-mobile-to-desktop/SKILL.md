## NEVER Do

- **NEVER keep touch-only controls** — Add mouse/keyboard alternatives. Touch controls on desktop feel awkward and limit precision.
- **NEVER lock to mobile resolution** — Desktop can handle 1920x1080+ and higher frame rates. Upscale UI, increase render distance.
- **NEVER hide graphics settings** — Desktop players expect quality options (resolution, VSync, shadows, anti-aliasing).
- **NEVER use mobile-sized UI** — Touch targets (44pt) are too large for mouse. Reduce button/text size by 30-50%.
- **NEVER forget window management** — Players expect fullscreen, borderless, maximize, and multi-monitor support.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.

### [desktop_input_adapter.gd](scripts/desktop_input_adapter.gd)
**MANDATORY first read for input remap** — Bridges mobile actions to keyboard/mouse without rewriting gameplay. Emits `mouse_look_bridge_requested` when FPS capture is needed — pair with mouse_capture_look.

### [hover_bridge.gd](scripts/hover_bridge.gd)
**MANDATORY when UI needs hover** — Restores desktop hover/focus affordances mobile never had. Prefer this over ad-hoc `mouse_entered` dumps.

### [mouse_capture_look.gd](scripts/mouse_capture_look.gd)
Captured look via `InputEventMouseMotion.relative` — use for FPS/orbit when adapter alone is not enough.

### [dynamic_window_manager.gd](scripts/dynamic_window_manager.gd)
**MANDATORY** — Windowed / exclusive fullscreen / borderless via DisplayServer.

### [keybinding_remapper.gd](scripts/keybinding_remapper.gd)
Runtime InputMap remap + ConfigFile persistence.

### [cursor_state_manager.gd](scripts/cursor_state_manager.gd)
Hardware cursor show/hide/combat vs menu states.

### [uncapped_framerate.gd](scripts/uncapped_framerate.gd)
VSync / `Engine.max_fps` unlock for 144Hz+.

### [resolution_dropdown.gd](scripts/resolution_dropdown.gd)
Native resolution OptionButton from `DisplayServer.screen_get_size`.

### [desktop_ui_scaler.gd](scripts/desktop_ui_scaler.gd)
**MANDATORY** — Shrink thumb-sized mobile Controls for mouse density.

### [scroll_wheel_zoom.gd](scripts/scroll_wheel_zoom.gd)
Mouse-wheel zoom replacing pinch.

### [quit_confirmation.gd](scripts/quit_confirmation.gd)
**MANDATORY** — `set_auto_accept_quit(false)` + save prompt on WM close.

### [multi_monitor_handling.gd](scripts/multi_monitor_handling.gd)
Launch/place window on the screen under the cursor.

## Decision Tree — Input Script Picks

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Map touch actions → WASD/mouse without rewriting movers | **desktop_input_adapter** |
| Button/Control hover styles & tooltips | **hover_bridge** |
| Captured mouselook (FPS/3P orbit) | **mouse_capture_look** — **MANDATORY** when aim/Look requires captured relative motion; adapter `get_aim_vector()` alone is top-down only |
| Rebindable keys | **keybinding_remapper** |
| Pinch → wheel zoom | **scroll_wheel_zoom** |

When `desktop_input_adapter` emits `mouse_look_bridge_requested`, attach or enable [mouse_capture_look.gd](scripts/mouse_capture_look.gd) on the player/camera rig — do not stop after InputMap injection.

## Port Procedure (ordered)

1. **MANDATORY** desktop_input_adapter (+ hover_bridge for UI) so every touch action has a precision equivalent.
2. desktop_ui_scaler + expanded layouts (hotbar/chat/minimap) — godot-ui-containers for structure.
3. dynamic_window_manager + multi_monitor_handling + quit_confirmation.
4. resolution_dropdown + uncapped_framerate + graphics quality ladder (persist ConfigFile).
5. Deeper OS integration → godot-platform-desktop.

## Platform Services Decision Tree (Steam / Discord)

| Goal | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Ship on Steam with cloud/achievements | Add **GDExtension** bridge (e.g. GodotSteam); keep init behind `OS.has_feature("steam")` / editor-safe stubs. Do **not** paste fake `Steam.*` tutorials into gameplay scripts. |
| Discord Rich Presence only | Prefer a thin GDExtension/plugin; update presence from an Autoload on scene change — never block `_ready` on network. |
| No store integration this milestone | **Cut** — omit Steam/Discord code paths entirely; document as future GDExtension spike. |

## Deep Recipes

> **MANDATORY** when porting beyond the ordered procedure: read [desktop-port-deep.md](references/desktop-port-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** it for a first-pass keyboard/mouse remap.

## Testing (before ship)

> **MANDATORY** before declaring the port complete: run [desktop-port-testing-checklist.md](references/desktop-port-testing-checklist.md). Do not inline a partial checklist — use the reference file.

## Expert Techniques (short)

- Optional lightweight launcher via `OS.create_process` + `user://settings.cfg` before main pack.
- Short FPS benchmark → write `user://override.cfg` quality suggestions.
- Graphics quality ladder (MSAA, shadow atlas, post-FX) and UI density tables live in [desktop-port-deep.md](references/desktop-port-deep.md) — open when port procedure rows are insufficient.
