## NEVER Do in Signal Architecture

- **NEVER use the legacy string-based `Object.connect()`** — Typos result in silent failures. Always use `signal.connect(_callback)` for compile-time validation.
- **NEVER use signals to dictate behavior top-down** — Signals are past-tense events (e.g., "died"). Use direct method calls for commands (e.g., "kill").
- **NEVER connect a signal twice to the same Callable** — This throws an `ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER` at runtime unless using the `Object.CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED` flag to stack connections.
- **NEVER use a Global Signal Bus for local data** — Pollutes global state and makes debugging harder. Use local connections for scene-specific logic.
- **NEVER assume callbacks must accept all signal arguments** — Use `unbind()` to drop unwanted parameters and keep your API clean.
- **NEVER create circular signal dependencies** — A signals B, B signals back to A? Use a mediator (parent or AutoLoad) to break the loop.
- **NEVER skip signal typing** — `signal moved` without types lacks editor support. Always use `signal moved(dir: Vector2)`.
- **NEVER forget to disconnect dynamic signals** — Ghost connections cause "call on null instance" errors. Disconnect in `_exit_tree()` or when retargeting ([disconnect_ghost_signals.gd](scripts/disconnect_ghost_signals.gd)).
- **NEVER emit signals with immediate side effects on the emitter** — If `died.emit()` calls `queue_free()`, listeners might fail to respond. Emit first.
- **NEVER use signals for high-frequency data streams** — Sending 1000+ signals/second (like per-particle updates) is inefficient. Use shared arrays or direct buffers.

## Signal Up / Call Down

- **Children → parents:** past-tense signals (`health_changed`, `died`).
- **Parents → children:** direct calls / properties (`apply_damage`, `play_anim`).
- **Siblings:** parent mediator or carefully scoped Autoload bus — never sibling hard refs.

**Use signals for:** UI presses, death → game over, loot → inventory, cross-scene bus events.
**Use direct calls for:** parent commanding child, local property access.

## Decision Tree: Where to Connect

| Scope | Pattern | MANDATORY script |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Child notifies parent / UI | Local `signal.connect` in parent `_ready` | [signal_up_call_down_pattern.gd](scripts/signal_up_call_down_pattern.gd) |
| Parent orchestrates children | Method calls down (not signals) | same |
| Cross-scene / systems (achievements, save) | Autoload bus | [global_signal_bus_router.gd](scripts/global_signal_bus_router.gd) / [global_event_bus.gd](scripts/global_event_bus.gd) |
| Linear async steps (load → fade → spawn) | `await` signal sequence | [await_signal_sequencing.gd](scripts/await_signal_sequencing.gd) / [complex_signal_sequencer.gd](scripts/complex_signal_sequencer.gd) |
| Retarget tracking (new enemy) | Disconnect old first | [disconnect_ghost_signals.gd](scripts/disconnect_ghost_signals.gd) |
| One-shot / physics-safe | `CONNECT_ONE_SHOT` / `CONNECT_DEFERRED` | [one_shot_deferred_connections.gd](scripts/one_shot_deferred_connections.gd) |
| Extra context / drop args | `Callable.bind` / `unbind` | [callable_bind_context.gd](scripts/callable_bind_context.gd) / [unbind_unwanted_args.gd](scripts/unbind_unwanted_args.gd) |

## Lambda Capture Cleanup (complete)

Godot auto-disconnects most connections when a node frees. **Exception:** lambdas that capture locals — you must disconnect manually.

```gdscript
var my_lambda: Callable

func _ready() -> void:
    var x := 10
    my_lambda = func(): print(x)
    player.died.connect(my_lambda)

func _exit_tree() -> void:
    if player and player.died.is_connected(my_lambda):
        player.died.disconnect(my_lambda)
```

Prefer named methods or [disconnect_ghost_signals.gd](scripts/disconnect_ghost_signals.gd) when retargeting.

## CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED — Correct Semantics

`CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED` means **multiple identical connects share one connection with a refcount** (connect N times / disconnect N times). It is **not** "auto-cleanup when the emitter frees" and does **not** fix capturing-lambda leaks.

- Auto-cleanup on free: normal connections to Object methods (non-capturing) are cleared when either side is freed.
- Capturing lambdas: always manual `disconnect` (see above).
- One-shot auto-remove after fire: `CONNECT_ONE_SHOT`.
