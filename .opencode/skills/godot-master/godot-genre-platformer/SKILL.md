## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Physics & Movement Feel
- NEVER multiply velocity by `delta` before `move_and_slide()`; the method internalizes the timestep.
- NEVER skip **Coyote Time** (approx 0.1s); without this grace period, jumps will feel unresponsive when walking off ledges.
- NEVER ignore **Jump Buffering** (approx 0.15s); players expect to jump the instant they touch the ground if they pressed the button early.
- NEVER use a fixed jump height; strictly implement **Variable Jump Height** (cut velocity on release) for player expression.
- NEVER forget to scale gravity by `delta` before adding to velocity; gravity is an acceleration and must be frame-rate independent.
- NEVER rely on discrete collision for high-speed movement; strictly use `CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY` to prevent tunneling through geometry.
- NEVER use `move_and_collide()` for standard traversal; it lacks the slope/stair handling of `move_and_slide()`.
- NEVER check coyote or buffer timers using exact equality (== 0.0); strictly use `is_equal_approx()` or `>= 0.0`.

### Polish & Level Design
- NEVER use linear camera snapping; strictly use **Camera Smoothing** or `lerp()` to prevent motion sickness.
- NEVER skip **Squash and Stretch** on jump/land; movement feels weightless without these subtle visual "juice" cues.
- NEVER create **Blind Jumps**; strictly use camera look-ahead or zoom triggers to reveal landing zones.
- NEVER use individual `Sprite2D` nodes for level geometry; strictly use **TileMapLayer** for optimized collision and rendering.
- NEVER use complex/concave `CollisionShape2D` for the player; strictly favor primitive shapes (Capsule/Rectangle) for stability.

### Architecture & Performance
- NEVER use `CharacterBody2D` for simple moving platforms; strictly use **AnimatableBody2D** and enable `sync_to_physics`.
- NEVER ignore `platform_on_leave` for descending platforms; use `PLATFORM_ON_LEAVE_ADD_UPWARD_VELOCITY` to preserve jump impulse.
- NEVER disable `recovery_as_collision` on the player character; it is required for correct floor snapping reports.
- NEVER use the `!` (NOT) operator in AnimationTree expressions; strictly use `is_walking == false`.
- NEVER use standard Strings for high-frequency state checks; strictly use `StringName` (e.g., `&"jumping"`).
- NEVER load heavy level chunks synchronously; strictly use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` to prevent frame stutters.

### World / camera / polish

## Movement Feel — Decision Knobs (not tutorials)

> **MANDATORY read**: [advanced_platformer_controller.gd](scripts/advanced_platformer_controller.gd) plus [coyote_timer.gd](scripts/coyote_timer.gd) / [jump_buffer.gd](scripts/jump_buffer.gd) / [variable_jump.gd](scripts/variable_jump.gd). Copy those modules; do not paste coyote/buffer recipes here.

Tune only these knobs in project code after reading the scripts:

| Knob | Expert default / note |
|------|------------------------|
| Coyote window | ~0.1s — without it, ledge jumps feel broken |
| Jump buffer | ~0.15s — early press must land as jump |
| Variable jump | Cut upward velocity on release |
| Apex / fall gravity | Higher fall multiplier after apex = snappier landings |
| CCD | Enable cast-ray CCD for fast projectiles / dashes |
| Moving platforms | `AnimatableBody2D` + `sync_to_physics`; set `platform_on_leave` |
| One-ways | [one_way_drop_handler.gd](scripts/one_way_drop_handler.gd) — mask/layers, not ad-hoc disable |

Ground: instant direction response. Air: slightly reduced accel. Gravity scaled by `delta`; never `velocity *= delta` before `move_and_slide()`.

## Level Design Principles

### The "Teaching Trilogy"
1. **Introduction** — safe learn → 2. **Challenge** — moderate risk → 3. **Twist** — combine / time pressure

### Flow and Pacing
`Easy → Easy → Medium → CHECKPOINT → Medium → Hard → CHECKPOINT → Boss`

### Camera
Use [platformer_camera.gd](scripts/platformer_camera.gd) / peer `godot-camera-systems` for look-ahead — never blind jumps.

## Platformer Sub-Genres

- **Precision** (Celeste / Super Meat Boy) — instant respawn, tight controls, frequent checkpoints
- **Collectathon** — hub worlds, ability unlocks, backtracking
- **Puzzle** — slow pacing, environmental physics
- **Metroidvania** — route to `godot-genre-metroidvania`

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Floaty jumps | Increase fall gravity after apex |
| Imprecise landings | Coyote + buffer modules + land juice |
| Unfair deaths | Hazards telegraphed before contact |
| Blind jumps | Look-ahead camera / zoom triggers |
| Boring mid-game | New mechanic every 2–3 levels |

## Polish Checklist

- [ ] Dust particles on land/run
- [ ] Screen shake on heavy landings (`godot-camera-systems` trauma)
- [ ] Squash/stretch on jump/land (visual pivot at feet)
- [ ] SFX for jump/land/wall-slide
- [ ] Checkpoint visual/audio feedback
- [ ] Assist mode / remappable controls

> **MANDATORY** for depth beyond decision trees and script catalog: [platformer-movement-deep.md](references/platformer-movement-deep.md). **Do NOT Load** on first-pass wiring — use bundled `scripts/` first.

## Godot-Specific Tips

1. **CharacterBody2D vs RigidBody2D**: Always use `CharacterBody2D` for platformer characters - precise control is essential
2. **Physics tick rate**: Consider 120Hz physics for smoother movement
3. **One-way platforms**: Use `set_collision_mask_value()` or dedicated collision layers
4. **Wall detection**: Use `is_on_wall()` and `get_wall_normal()` for wall jumps
