# Migration notes: godot-genre-simulation

Incremental upgrade for topics this skill covers. Apply **one hop**, stabilize/test, then next. Never skip hops.

If the project is **< 4.0**, follow [godot-version-migration](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-version-migration/SKILL.md) era bridges (legacy → 3→4) until 4.0, then these hops. Official 3→4: [Upgrading from Godot 3 to Godot 4](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.html).

## 4.0 → 4.1

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.1](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.1.html)

*No skill-relevant breaking changes for this hop.*

## 4.1 → 4.2

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.2](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.2.html)

*No skill-relevant breaking changes for this hop.*

## 4.2 → 4.3

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.3](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.3.html)

- If the genre uses TileMap, migrate to TileMapLayer nodes before relying on layer APIs.
- If the genre ships multiplayer, upgrade all peers to 4.3 together (SceneMultiplayer protocol).
- Scripted Object / typed Array binary serialization changes — verify Resource round-trips.
- Large PackedByteArray storage format may not open in older editors.

## 4.3 → 4.4

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.4](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.4.html)

- `@export_file` → `uid://` in Inspector-assigned values.
- `Curve` clamps to configured min/max.

## 4.4 → 4.5

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.5](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.5.html)

- Resource deep-duplicate and UID export-file changes affect inventory/quest/economy Resource graphs.
- `Resource.duplicate(true)` no longer deep-copies external resources by default.

## 4.5 → 4.6

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.6](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.6.html)

- Retune Environment glow/fog if the genre leans on bloom-heavy looks.
- First save in 4.6 rewrites scenes with unique node IDs.

## 4.6 → 4.7

Official: [Upgrading to Godot 4.7](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.7.html)

- Confirm project stretch mode and AudioStreamPlayer area_mask after opening in 4.7.
- Re-validate Resource pipelines after packed-array setter and typed-return GDScript changes.
