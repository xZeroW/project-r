# CharacterBody2D Implementation

Expert CharacterBody2D feel systems — not beginner `move_and_slide` tutorials.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER use `RigidBody2D` for standard player controllers** — RigidBody is for physics-simulated objects. For responsive, feel-driven player movement, always use `CharacterBody2D`.
- **NEVER multiply `velocity` by `delta` before `move_and_slide()`** — `move_and_slide()` handles delta internally. Manual multiplication makes movement framerate-dependent.
- **NEVER use `global_position` updates for gameplay movement** — Use `velocity` + `move_and_slide()`. Direct position hacks bypass collision, floor snap, and one-way rules.
- **NEVER "fall through" one-ways by nudging `position.y`** — Use one-way collision shapes + layer/mask (and temporary mask disable / collide-with-areas patterns). See [godot-2d-physics](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-2d-physics/SKILL.md).
- **NEVER ignore floor/wall/ceiling state right after `move_and_slide()`** — `is_on_floor()`, `is_on_wall()`, `is_on_ceiling()`, and slide collisions drive coyote, wall jump, and bonk logic.
- **NEVER rely on default `floor_snap_length` for fast stair-climbing** — Default snapping is too small for high-velocity characters. Use custom raycast-based stair logic.
- **NEVER apply gravity while `is_on_floor()` is true** — Constant downward force causes micro-jitter and fights floor-snap. Reset `velocity.y` on land.
- **NEVER use `Area2D` as primary ground detection** — Prefer `is_on_floor()` / shapecasts; Areas are for triggers, not floor truth.
- **NEVER forget ceiling bonk** — Reset `velocity.y` when `is_on_ceiling()` or the player floats into the ceiling until gravity wins.
- **NEVER round physics positions for pixel art** — Keep physics high-precision; round **sprite** positions in `_process` only ([subpixel_movement_rounding.gd](scripts/subpixel_movement_rounding.gd)).
- **NEVER spam `queue_free()` for hordes** — Pool bullets/enemies when spawn/despawn is frequent ([performance_character_pooling.gd](scripts/performance_character_pooling.gd)).

**Golden path:** Read **expert_physics_2d.gd** first. Add dash/wall/jump scripts only after that controller is in place. Do not re-inline coyote/buffer/accel loops in the scene when the script already owns them.

## One-Way Platforms (correct recipe)

1. Author one-way on the **platform collider** (`CollisionShape2D` one-way / TileSet physics one-way), not by teleporting the player.
2. Put platforms and player on explicit **collision layers/masks** so drop-through can temporarily clear the platform bit (or disable collide-with) while holding down + jump — then restore next physics frames.
3. Keep drop-through on the **physics tick**; never bypass `move_and_slide` with `position` nudges.
4. For tile one-ways, align TileSet physics layers with CharacterBody masks — see [godot-tilemap-mastery](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-tilemap-mastery/SKILL.md) + [godot-2d-physics](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-2d-physics/SKILL.md).

## Expert Character Architectures

### 1. Wall Cling (Variable Friction)
Monitor `is_on_wall()` while falling; scale `velocity.y` by a friction factor (optionally from tile custom data) instead of a binary wall-slide bool. Prefer [wall_slide_jump_refined.gd](scripts/wall_slide_jump_refined.gd) over a bespoke cling fork.

### 2. Animation-Driven Movement (Root Motion)
Pull `AnimationTree.get_root_motion_position()`, convert to 2D, assign `velocity = motion / delta`, then `move_and_slide()`. Keeps feet locked to authored clips; pair with [godot-2d-animation](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-2d-animation/SKILL.md).

### 3. Game-Feel Profiler (Jump Arcs)
Debug-draw historical positions + current velocity in `_draw()` to visualize apex, coyote, and buffer windows while tuning exports on **expert_physics_2d.gd** — [game_feel_profiler.gd](scripts/game_feel_profiler.gd).

> **MANDATORY** for top-down/tank recipes, moving platforms, slide-collision response, and gotcha tables: [movement-recipes.md](references/movement-recipes.md). **Do NOT Load** when expert_physics_2d.gd already covers your platformer scope.
