# AnimationPlayer

Timeline-based keyframe animation: track choice, RESET, root motion, libraries — scripts own recipes.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER forget RESET tracks** — Animated properties otherwise stick across scene changes.
- **NEVER use `Animation.CALL_MODE_CONTINUOUS` for one-shot logic** — Use `CALL_MODE_DISCRETE`.
- **NEVER animate embedded resource properties directly** — Prefer instance uniforms / owned materials.
- **NEVER use `animation_finished` for looping clips** — Use `animation_looped` or poll `current_animation`.
- **NEVER hardcode animation name strings at scale** — Constants / `StringName`.
- **NEVER `seek()` without `update=true` when same-frame reads matter**.
- **NEVER leave off-screen visual-only players `active`** — Cull with notifiers.
- **NEVER mutate a playing `AnimationLibrary`** — Stop / wait for finished first.
- **NEVER rely on `speed_scale` for long sync** — Prefer `seek()` against a shared clock.

## Critical WHY (keep in body)

- **`CALL_MODE_CONTINUOUS`** invokes the method **every frame** across the key span — one-shot hitboxes/VFX need **`CALL_MODE_DISCRETE`**.
- Animating embedded **sub-resource** properties (e.g. `material.albedo_color`) duplicates resources into the scene — use instanced materials / `shader_parameter/*` tracks.
- **`animation_finished`** does not fire on looping clips — use `animation_looped` or poll `current_animation`.
- Mutating a playing **`AnimationLibrary`** crashes or leaves bad transforms — stop or await finished before swap.
- **`speed_scale`** drifts for rhythm/multiplayer — shared-clock **`seek(t, true)`** for long sync.

## Track decision matrix

| Track | Use when | Avoid when |
|---|---|---|
| **Value** | Animate properties (pos, modulate, uniforms) | One-off runtime juice → Tween |
| **Method** | Hitboxes, SFX hooks, state flips at timestamps | CONTINUOUS call mode / missing method on path |
| **Audio** | Footsteps / VO locked to frames | Loose `AudioStreamPlayer.play()` drift |
| **Bezier** | Custom easing curves sampled at runtime | Simple linear fades |

Track authoring samples → [track-authoring.md](references/track-authoring.md).

## Root motion (physics)

`CharacterBody3D` + `Skeleton3D` + `AnimationPlayer`: extract with `get_root_motion_position()` / rotation on the **physics** tick — [root_motion_physics_sync.gd](scripts/root_motion_physics_sync.gd). Walk cycles that only move bones leave the body collider behind.

## Sequences, blends, RESET

- Chain: `animation_set_next` / `queue` / [animation_sequencer.gd](scripts/animation_sequencer.gd).
- Blend times for walk↔run polish; `play("run", -1, 1.0, 0.5)` or `set_default_blend_time`.
- Always author a **RESET** clip with defaults; enable Reset on Save when editing.
- Reverse playback: `play("clip", -1, -1.0)` for doors/cinematic rewind.

## AnimationPlayer vs Tween

| Need | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Timeline / many properties / reusable | **AnimationPlayer** |
| One-shot runtime / interruptible | **Tween** ([godot-tweening](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-tweening/SKILL.md)) |

## Expert architecture (scripts)

| Pattern | Script | WHY |
|---|---|---|
| Shared humanoid libraries | [runtime_anim_lib_swapper.gd](scripts/runtime_anim_lib_swapper.gd) | One library, many models — play `lib/clip` |
| Decoupled timeline events | [method_track_logic.gd](scripts/method_track_logic.gd) | Method track → signaler → gameplay listeners |
| Off-screen CPU budget | [active_animation_culler.gd](scripts/active_animation_culler.gd) | `active = false` or manual `advance()` |
| Code-built clips | [programmatic_anim.gd](scripts/programmatic_anim.gd) | Dynamic targets not in FBX |
