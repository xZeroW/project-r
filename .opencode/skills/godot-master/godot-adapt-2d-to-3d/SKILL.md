## NEVER Do

- **NEVER directly replace Vector2 with Vector3(x, y, 0)** — This creates a "flat 3D" game with no depth gameplay. Add Z-axis movement or camera rotation to justify 3D.
- **NEVER keep 2D collision layers** — 2D and 3D physics use separate layer systems. You must reconfigure collision_layer/collision_mask for 3D nodes.
- **NEVER forget to add lighting** — 3D without lights is pitch black (unless using unlit materials). Add at least one DirectionalLight3D.
- **NEVER use Camera2D follow logic in 3D** — Camera3D needs spring arm or look-at logic. Direct position copying causes clipping and disorientation.
- **NEVER assume same performance** — 3D is 5-10x more demanding. Budget for lower draw calls, smaller viewport resolution on mobile.
- **NEVER use the rotation property for complex 3D logic** — 3D rotation uses Euler angles. Interpolating Euler angles causes unpredictable paths and Gimbal Lock. Always use `Quaternion` for 3D rotation interpolation or the `Basis` matrix for directional vectors.
- **NEVER ignore metric scaling** — 3D physics and lighting assume 1 unit = 1 meter. Scaling models inside the engine introduces precision errors. Export assets from DCCs at the correct metric scale.
- **NEVER disable physics interpolation when using custom camera follow scripts** — Updating camera position in `_process` to follow a body moving in `_physics_process` causes jitter. Use `Node3D.get_global_transform_interpolated()` for smooth transforms.

|---------|---------------|-------|
| CharacterBody2D | CharacterBody3D | **MANDATORY** `characterbody3d_migration_movement.gd` |
| RigidBody2D | RigidBody3D | Gravity `Vector3(0, -9.8, 0)` |

---

## Migration Steps (script-first)

1. **Physics layers** — **MANDATORY** [`physics_layer_migration_checklist.gd`](scripts/physics_layer_migration_checklist.gd). Project Settings → Layer Names → **3D Physics**.
2. **Camera** — **MANDATORY** [`spring_arm_camera_setup.gd`](scripts/spring_arm_camera_setup.gd). Never copy Camera2D follow onto Camera3D.
3. **Movement** — **MANDATORY** [`characterbody3d_migration_movement.gd`](scripts/characterbody3d_migration_movement.gd). Camera-relative XZ; jump on Y.

---

## Art Pipeline: Sprites → 3D Models

### Option 1: Billboard Sprites (2.5D)

```gdscript
# Use Sprite3D for quick conversion
extends Sprite3D

func _ready() -> void:
    texture = load("res://sprites/character.png")
    billboard = BaseMaterial3D.BILLBOARD_ENABLED  # Always face camera
    pixel_size = 0.01  # Scale sprite in 3D space
```

### Option 2: Quad Meshes (Floating Sprites)

```gdscript
# Create textured quads
var mesh_instance := MeshInstance3D.new()
var quad := QuadMesh.new()
quad.size = Vector2(1, 1)
mesh_instance.mesh = quad

var material := StandardMaterial3D.new()
material.albedo_texture = load("res://sprites/character.png")
material.transparency = BaseMaterial3D.TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA
material.cull_mode = BaseMaterial3D.CULL_DISABLED  # Show both sides
mesh_instance.material_override = material
```

### Option 3: Full 3D Models (Blender/Asset Library)

```gdscript
# Import .glb, .fbx models
var character := load("res://models/character.glb").instantiate()
add_child(character)

# Access animations
var anim_player := character.get_node("AnimationPlayer")
anim_player.play("idle")
```

## Lighting Considerations

Minimum: one `DirectionalLight3D` + `WorldEnvironment` ambient so the scene is not black. **Do NOT Load** cascade/GI/bake tutorials in this skill — [godot-3d-lighting](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-3d-lighting/SKILL.md).

---

## UI Adaptation

```gdscript
# ✅ GOOD: Keep 2D UI overlay
# Scene structure:
# Main (Node3D)
#   ├─ WorldEnvironment
#   ├─ DirectionalLight3D
#   ├─ Player (CharacterBody3D)
#   └─ CanvasLayer  # 2D UI on top of 3D world
#       └─ Control (HUD)

# UI remains 2D (Control nodes, Sprite2D for HUD elements)
```

---

## Performance Budgeting (profiler gates)

Speculative "2D vs 3D budget" tables lie. Gate on measured data:

1. **Open Profiler / Debugger → Monitors** after the port runs on target hardware.
2. **Draw calls / primitives** — if MeshInstance count explodes, add Mesh LOD / Visibility Ranges before guessing vertex caps.
3. **Shadow cost** — lower `directional_shadow_max_distance` and shadowed Omni/Spot count until frame time recovers (tune in godot-3d-lighting).
4. **LOD procedure** — set `visibility_range_*` on distant GeometryInstance3D; unlit/simplified materials past the near band.
5. **Fail gate** — ship only when 95th-percentile frame time meets the platform target (e.g. ≤16.6 ms for 60 FPS), not when a spreadsheet says "50–100 draw calls".

---

## Input Scheme Changes

### 2D → 3D Input Mapping

```gdscript
# 2D: left/right for horizontal movement
Input.get_axis("left", "right")

# 3D: Add forward/back, use get_vector()
var input := Input.get_vector("left", "right", "forward", "back")
# Returns Vector2(horizontal, vertical) for 3D movement

# Configure in Project Settings → Input Map:
# forward: W, Up Arrow
# back: S, Down Arrow
# left: A, Left Arrow
# right: D, Right Arrow

# Mouse look (lock cursor)
func _ready() -> void:
    Input.mouse_mode = Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED

func _input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion and Input.mouse_mode == Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:
        rotate_camera(event.relative)
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Physics Not Working

```gdscript
# Problem: Forgot to set collision layers for 3D
# Solution: Reconfigure layers

var body := CharacterBody3D.new()
body.collision_layer = 0b0001  # What AM I?
body.collision_mask = 0b0110   # What do I DETECT?
```

### Camera Clipping Through Walls

Use **MANDATORY** [`spring_arm_camera_setup.gd`](scripts/spring_arm_camera_setup.gd) — set `spring_arm.collision_mask` to the World layer so the boom retracts instead of clipping.

### Player Falling Through Floor

```gdscript
# Problem: StaticBody3D floor has no CollisionShape3D
# Solution: Add collision

var floor_collision := CollisionShape3D.new()
var box_shape := BoxShape3D.new()
box_shape.size = Vector3(100, 1, 100)
floor_collision.shape = box_shape
floor.add_child(floor_collision)
```

## Decision Tree: When to Go 3D

| Factor | Stay 2D | Go 3D |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Gameplay** | Platformer, top-down, no depth needed | Exploration, first-person, 3D space combat |
| **Art budget** | Pixel art, limited resources | 3D models available or necessary |
| **Performance target** | Mobile, web, low-end | Desktop, console, high-end mobile |
| **Development time** | Limited | Have time for 3D learning curve |
| **Team skills** | 2D artists only | 3D artists or asset library |

## Expert Techniques & Optimizations

### 1. Vector Math over Euler Angles
When moving a 3D character, rely heavily on `Transform3D` basis vectors rather than calculating trigonometric angles. To move forward locally, extract the negative Z-axis of your transform's basis: `velocity = transform.basis.z * speed`.

### 2. Understanding Coordinate Discrepancies
In 2D, the Y-axis points down. In 3D, Godot uses a right-handed system where Y-axis points UP, and forward is -Z. Translating 2D jumps to 3D requires inverting the Y velocity logic (e.g., `velocity.y = JUMP_SPEED` instead of `-JUMP_SPEED`).

### 3. 2.5D Navigation (Camera-Projected Paths)
For 2.5D games where actors move on a 3D floor but are displayed as 2D sprites, query the `NavigationServer3D` directly and project the resulting `PackedVector3Array` into 2D screen space (or a flattened gameplay plane) using `Camera3D.unproject_position`.

```gdscript
class_name NavigationBridge2D5D extends Node

## Projects 3D NavigationServer paths to 2D screenspace for 2.5D movement.
static func query_2_5d_path(camera: Camera3D, map_rid: RID, start_2d: Vector2, target_2d: Vector2) -> PackedVector2Array:
    # 1. Project 2D screen points to the 3D ground plane (Y=0).
    var start_3d := camera.project_position(start_2d, 0.0)
    var target_3d := camera.project_position(target_2d, 0.0)
    
    # 2. Query optimized 3D path.
    var path_3d := NavigationServer3D.map_get_path(map_rid, start_3d, target_3d, true)
    
    # 3. Project 3D world points back to 2D screenspace coordinates for the sprite.
    var path_2d := PackedVector2Array()
    for point in path_3d:
        path_2d.append(camera.unproject_position(point))
        
    return path_2d
```

### 4. Shader-Based Billboarding (Massive Crowd Rendering)
To render millions of instances, use `MultiMeshInstance3D` paired with a custom Visual Shader. Use `VisualShaderNodeBillboard` with `BILLBOARD_TYPE_FIXED_Y` to ensure sprites stay upright on flat terrain.

```gdscript
class_name MassiveCrowdManager extends MultiMeshInstance3D
## Efficiently manages millions of camera-facing instances via GPU hardware.

func _ready() -> void:
    # 1. Configure the MultiMesh for 3D transforms.
    multimesh = MultiMesh.new()
    multimesh.transform_format = MultiMesh.TRANSFORM_3D
    multimesh.instance_count = 10000
    
    # 2. Build a ShaderMaterial using VisualShaderNodeBillboard.
    var material := ShaderMaterial.new()
    # Note: Logic assumes billboard_type=BILLBOARD_TYPE_FIXED_Y and keep_scale=true.
    multimesh.mesh = QuadMesh.new()
    multimesh.mesh.surface_set_material(0, material)
    
    # 3. Populate transforms. The GPU handles orientation.
    for i in range(multimesh.instance_count):
        var pos := Vector3(randf() * 100, 0, randf() * 100)
        multimesh.set_instance_transform(i, Transform3D(Basis(), pos))
```

### 5. Lighting Migration

PointLight2D→OmniLight3D conversion is one-shot editor work — keep a project tool if needed. Ongoing lighting quality belongs in godot-3d-lighting.
