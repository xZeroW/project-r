## NEVER Do

- **NEVER remove Z-axis without gameplay compensation** — Blindly flattening 3D to 2D removes spatial strategy. Add other depth mechanics (layers, jump height variations).
- **NEVER keep 3D collision shapes** — Use simpler 2D shapes (CapsuleShape2D, RectangleShape2D). 3D shapes don't convert automatically.
- **NEVER use orthographic Camera3D as "2D mode"** — WHY: You still pay 3D transform/lighting costs and miss CanvasItem batching. Use Camera2D + 2D nodes ([`ortho_simulation.gd`](scripts/ortho_simulation.gd) only for simulated height).
- **NEVER assume automatic performance gain** — Poorly optimized 2D (too many draw calls, large sprite sheets) can be slower than optimized 3D.
- **NEVER forget to adjust gravity** — 3D gravity is Vector3(0, -9.8, 0). 2D gravity is float (980 pixels/s²). Scale appropriately.
- **NEVER treat ground and air hits as the same Area2D overlap** — In 2.5D, a ground slash must not hit jumping targets. WHY: 2D physics has no Z. Use [`hitbox_depth_manager.gd`](scripts/hitbox_depth_manager.gd) height AABB checks.
- **NEVER fight Y-sort with per-sprite `z_index` spam** — WHY: Ownership of sort order belongs on the Y-sorted parent. Use [`depth_sorting_y_sort.gd`](scripts/depth_sorting_y_sort.gd); manual z_index drifts every frame.

## Dimension Reduction Strategies

Pick one row from the strategy router above — do not paste conversion tutorials in-scene.

| Strategy | Intent | Scripts |
|----------|--------|---------|
| True 2D | Drop Z; `Vector2` velocity; Camera2D | Peer `godot-characterbody-2d` / `godot-camera-systems` |
| 2.5D / fake depth | Simulated height + Y-sort ownership + ground-vs-air hitboxes | `ortho_simulation.gd`, `jump_z_axis_sim.gd`, `hitbox_depth_manager.gd`, `depth_sorting_y_sort.gd` |
| Isometric stay | 2D physics + iso projection | **MANDATORY** `isometric_math_core.gd` |

Gravity scale: 3D `9.8` m/s² → 2D `~980` px/s² when 1 m ≈ 100 px. Collisions: CapsuleShape3D → CapsuleShape2D (see Physics Adjustments). Camera: Camera3D/SpringArm → Camera2D — **NEVER** ortho Camera3D as “2D mode”.

---

## Art Pipeline: 3D Models → Sprites

**MANDATORY** when baking multi-angle sprites from GLB/scenes: [`model_to_sprite_bake.gd`](scripts/model_to_sprite_bake.gd) (`@tool` SubViewport baker).
Manual Blender export stays outside this skill. Strategy choice stays in the decision tree below — do not re-inline bake recipes in the body.

---

## Physics Adjustments

### Gravity Scaling

```gdscript
# 3D gravity (m/s²): 9.8
# 2D gravity (pixels/s²): Scale to pixel units

# If 1 meter = 100 pixels:
const GRAVITY_2D = 9.8 * 100  # = 980 pixels/s²

# Adjust jump velocity proportionally:
# 3D jump: 4.5 m/s
# 2D jump: -450 pixels/s
```

### Collision Simplification

```gdscript
# 3D: CapsuleShape3D (16 segments, expensive)
var shape_3d := CapsuleShape3D.new()
shape_3d.radius = 0.5
shape_3d.height = 2.0

# 2D: CapsuleShape2D (much simpler)
var shape_2d := CapsuleShape2D.new()
shape_2d.radius = 16  # pixels
shape_2d.height = 64
```

---

## Control Simplification

### 3D Free Movement → 2D Restricted

```gdscript
# 3D: Full 3D movement with camera-relative controls
var input_3d := Input.get_vector("left", "right", "forward", "back")
var camera_basis := camera.global_transform.basis
var direction := (camera_basis * Vector3(input_3d.x, 0, input_3d.y)).normalized()

# 2D: Simple 4-direction (or 8-direction with diagonals)
var input_2d := Input.get_vector("left", "right", "up", "down")
velocity = input_2d.normalized() * SPEED
```

---

## Performance Gains

### Optimization Techniques

```gdscript
# 1. Use TileMapLayer instead of individual Sprite2D nodes
var tilemap := TileMapLayer.new()
tilemap.tile_set = load("res://tileset.tres")

# 2. Batch sprite rendering
# Use single large sprite sheet instead of individual textures

# 3. Reduce particle count
var godot-particles := GPUParticles2D.new()
godot-particles.amount = 50  # Down from 200 in 3D
```

---

## UI Adaptation

```gdscript
# Most 3D games already use 2D UI (CanvasLayer)
# No changes needed!

# Just verify UI scaling for new aspect ratios
get_viewport().size_changed.connect(_on_viewport_resized)

func _on_viewport_resized() -> void:
    var viewport_size := get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size
    # Adjust UI anchors/margins
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Depth Sorting

**NEVER** drive sort with per-sprite `z_index = int(global_position.y)` — that contradicts Y-sort ownership. **MANDATORY** [`depth_sorting_y_sort.gd`](scripts/depth_sorting_y_sort.gd): enable `y_sort_enabled` on the parent and keep children at default relative z.

### Lost Spatial Audio

```gdscript
# 3D spatial audio (AudioStreamPlayer3D) → 2D panning (AudioStreamPlayer2D)

var audio_2d := AudioStreamPlayer2D.new()
audio_2d.stream = load("res://sounds/footstep.ogg")
audio_2d.max_distance = 1000.0  # 2D range
audio_2d.attenuation = 2.0
add_child(audio_2d)
```

---

## Decision Tree: When to Simplify to 2D

| Factor | Keep 3D | Go 2D |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Target platform** | Desktop, console | Mobile, web |
| **Art style** | Realistic, immersive | Stylized, retro |
| **Gameplay** | Requires 3D space | Works in 2D plane |
| **Performance** | Have GPU budget | Need 60 FPS on low-end |
| **Team skills** | 3D artists | 2D artists or pixel art |

## Expert Techniques & Optimizations

### 1. Flattened Navigation (3D Navmesh to 2D Grid)
While Godot treats 2D and 3D navigation as separate systems, you can project 3D pathfinding logic onto a 2D grid using `AStarGrid2D`. This is highly optimized for 2D grid-based movement and avoids the overhead of a full 3D navmesh.

```gdscript
class_name GridNavBridge extends Node

var astar_grid: AStarGrid2D

func _ready() -> void:
    astar_grid = AStarGrid2D.new()
    astar_grid.region = Rect2i(0, 0, 100, 100)
    astar_grid.cell_size = Vector2(16, 16)
    astar_grid.update()

## Converts a 3D target position to a 2D grid path.
func get_grid_path_from_3d(start_3d: Vector3, end_3d: Vector3) -> PackedVector2Array:
    var start_map := Vector2i(start_3d.x / 16, start_3d.z / 16)
    var end_map := Vector2i(end_3d.x / 16, end_3d.z / 16)
    
    return astar_grid.get_point_path(start_map, end_map)
```

### 2. Auto-LOD for 2D (Performance Optimization)
Automatic LOD is natively a 3D feature, but you can simulate it in 2D using `VisibleOnScreenEnabler2D`. This node automatically toggles the `process_mode` of target nodes (like high-res sprites or complex AI) when they leave the screen, preserving CPU cycles and GPU fill rate.

```gdscript
# Attach to a complex 2D entity
func setup_2d_lod(target_node: Node2D) -> void:
    var enabler := VisibleOnScreenEnabler2D.new()
    # Define the 'high-detail' rect
    enabler.rect = Rect2(-64, -64, 128, 128) 
    enabler.enable_node_path = target_node.get_path()
    add_child(enabler)
```

### 3. Dimensional Patcher (CharacterBody3D to 2D Regex)
To automate the down-porting of 3D controllers, use a `RegEx` script to map `Vector3` to `Vector2` and replace 3D-specific properties. This is essential for massive porting tasks where manual conversion of movement logic is prone to error.

```gdscript
@tool
extends EditorScript

func _run() -> void:
    var regex = RegEx.new()
    # Pattern to find Vector3 constructors and replace with Vector2
    regex.compile("Vector3\\(([^,]+),\\s*([^,]+),\\s*([^)]+)\\)")
    
    var script_content = "velocity = Vector3(input.x, 0.0, input.y) * speed"
    var result = regex.sub(script_content, "Vector2($1, $3)", true)
    
    # Output: "velocity = Vector2(input.x, input.y) * speed"
    print(result)
```
