## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Frame-Data & Logic
- NEVER use variable framerates; strictly lock logic to a **Deterministic Fixed Loop** (using `_physics_process` with a frame-counter) and call **`reset_physics_interpolation()`** on teleport.
- NEVER use standard Physics for hit detection; strictly use **`PhysicsDirectSpaceState.intersect_shape()`** to query hitboxes instantly without Area2D signal lag.
- NEVER skip **Damage Scaling**; strictly apply 10% reduction per hit in a combo to prevent infinite matches.
- NEVER make all moves safe on block; strictly ensure high-reward moves have **Recovery Windows** where the attacker is punishable.
- NEVER rely on `Area2D.get_overlapping_areas()`; strictly use **`intersect_shape()`** for immediate, frame-perfect resolution.
- NEVER forget **Hitbox Proximity (Proximity Guard)**; strictly trigger guard states when a hitbox enters a nearby zone, even if it hasn't landed.

### Character & Animation
- NEVER use simple parenting (`scale.x = -1`) for character flip; strictly adjust the dedicated **Visuals node** while managing hitbox offsets programmatically.
- NEVER use string-based animation triggers; strictly use `AnimationMixer` with `ADVANCE_MANUAL` for frame-synced playback.
- NEVER use `yield` or `await` for frame-critical logic; strictly use **Integer Frame Counting** within state machines to manage recovery/startup windows perfectly.
- NEVER store frame data in raw scripts; strictly use **`Resource` files (.tres)** with delegated logic for damage scaling, cancels, and combo-state tracking.
- NEVER use deep node hierarchies for character parts; strictly keep skeletons shallow to reduce transformation overhead.

### Input & Networking
- NEVER skip **Input Buffering**; strictly implement a 5-10 frame buffer to ensure lenient, responsive execution for the player.
- NEVER leave `Input.use_accumulated_input` enabled; strictly disable it to preserve sub-frame timing for precise combo links.
- NEVER use client-side hit detection for netplay; strictly use **rollback netcode** or server validation to prevent desyncs.
- NEVER use standard TCP for multiplayer; strictly use **UDP/ENet** to avoid head-of-line blocking during latency spikes.
- NEVER rely on the SceneTree for fighter transforms in netplay; strictly manage positions in a **serializable data buffer**.

## Balance Guidelines

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Health | 10,000-15,000 for ~20 second rounds |
| Combo damage | Max 30-40% of health per touch |
| Fastest moves | 3-5 frames startup (jabs) |
| Slowest moves | 20-40 frames (supers, overheads) |
| Throw range | Short but reliable |
| Meter gain | Full bar in ~2 combos received |

For roster / matchup simulation, use [godot-monte-carlo-balancer](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-monte-carlo-balancer/SKILL.md).

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Infinite combos | Hitstun decay + gravity scaling |
| Area2D signal hits | Replace with [direct_hitbox_query.gd](scripts/direct_hitbox_query.gd) |
| Lag input drops | Buffer 8+ frames |
| Desync | Deterministic loop + rollback serializer |
