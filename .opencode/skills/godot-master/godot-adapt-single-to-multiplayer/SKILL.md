## NEVER Do (Expert Multiplayer Rules)

### Security & Authority
- **NEVER trust client-reported state** — Clients own their 'Input', NOT their 'Position' or 'Health'. Server must validate every coordinate and health change.
- **NEVER use `get_tree()` groups for authority checks** — Use `is_multiplayer_authority()`. Group registration is non-deterministic in high-latency joins.
- **NEVER allow unrestricted RPC rates** — A malicious client can call a 'FireWeapon' RPC 10,000 times per second. Always implement rate-limiting (`net_rpc_rate_limiter.gd`).

### Movement & Lag
- **NEVER skip Client-Side Prediction** — Movement without prediction feels 'heavy' and unresponsive. Predict movement locally, then correct only on server disagreement.
- **NEVER sync peers at 60Hz** — Sending entire state every frame will saturate client bandwidth. Use a lower tick-rate (20-30Hz) and interpolate between packets.
- **NEVER snap peer positions** — Abrupt position updates cause 'jitter'. Store a buffer of past states and lerp between them with a 100ms delay.

### Bandwidth & Sync
- **NEVER sync 'Full Floats' if possible** — Quantize Vector3 data (truncating decimals) to save 50%+ bandwidth. Use `MultiplayerSynchronizer` with delta-sync enabled.
- **NEVER ignore 'Late Joiners'** — Players who join mid-game won't see existing environmental changes. Broadcast a full world-state 'Snapshot' on peer connection.
- **NEVER test on 0ms ping** — Everything works on localhost. Use a simulator (`net_latency_simulator.gd`) with 150ms ping to identify sync bugs.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Architecture decision tree first, then golden-path scripts. Deep latency workflows → [`references/latency-testing.md`](references/latency-testing.md).

### Authority / transport bridges
### [multiplayer_sync.gd](scripts/multiplayer_sync.gd)
**MANDATORY** when adding `MultiplayerSynchronizer` interpolation for remote peers. Trigger: authority owns transforms; non-authority interpolates.

### [rpc_bridge.gd](scripts/rpc_bridge.gd)
**MANDATORY** signal→RPC bridge. Trigger: gameplay emits local signals; bridge validates authority and fans out RPCs.

### Prediction / lag / lobby
### [net_prediction_reconciliation.gd](scripts/net_prediction_reconciliation.gd)
CharacterBody prediction + input-buffer replay for server reconciliation.

### [net_snapshot_interpolation.gd](scripts/net_snapshot_interpolation.gd)
Snapshot interpolation / jitter buffers for remote peers.

### [net_auth_server_validator.gd](scripts/net_auth_server_validator.gd)
Authoritative validation (position, speed, actions).

### [net_rpc_rate_limiter.gd](scripts/net_rpc_rate_limiter.gd)
RPC flood / macro protection.

### [net_interest_management.gd](scripts/net_interest_management.gd)
Distance-based visibility to cut bandwidth.

### [net_delta_compression_sync.gd](scripts/net_delta_compression_sync.gd)
Quantization + significance checks for delta sync.

### [net_lag_compensation.gd](scripts/net_lag_compensation.gd)
Server-side rewind for hit registration.

### [net_lobby_late_join_sync.gd](scripts/net_lobby_late_join_sync.gd)
Late-joiner world snapshot bootstrap.

### Diagnostics
### [net_latency_simulator.gd](scripts/net_latency_simulator.gd)
**MANDATORY** before ship — see [`references/latency-testing.md`](references/latency-testing.md).

### [net_debug_overlay_monitor.gd](scripts/net_debug_overlay_monitor.gd)
RTT / loss / jitter overlay.

### [net_upnp_discovery_logic.gd](scripts/net_upnp_discovery_logic.gd)
UPNP port mapping for listen-server / P2P hosts.

## Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | When | Script golden path |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| Authoritative server | PvP, economies, cheat risk | `rpc_bridge.gd` → `net_auth_server_validator.gd` → prediction/recon |
| P2P lockstep | 2–4 co-op, low cheat risk | Deterministic inputs + `net_upnp_discovery_logic.gd` |
| Hybrid / host authority | Party games 4–8 | Host authority + late-join snapshot |

---

## Migration golden path (no inline host/join tutorials)

1. Separate **input** (client) from **simulation** (authority).
2. Set `multiplayer_authority` per player node; clients send intents only.
3. **MANDATORY** `multiplayer_sync.gd` for property replication / remote interpolation.
4. **MANDATORY** `rpc_bridge.gd` for gameplay events that cross the wire.
5. Add prediction / lag compensation scripts only for the genres that need them.
6. Validate with **latency-testing** reference + `net_latency_simulator.gd` at ~150 ms RTT.

## Expert insights (WHY — keep in body)

- **Client prediction** — WHY: without local sim, RTT doubles perceived input lag. Replay buffered inputs after server correction ([net_prediction_reconciliation.gd](scripts/net_prediction_reconciliation.gd)).
- **Interpolation buffer** — WHY: raw sync packets jitter; lerp between snapshots with ~100 ms delay ([net_snapshot_interpolation.gd](scripts/net_snapshot_interpolation.gd)).
- **Hit rewind** — WHY: clients fire at past world state; server rewinds RIDs via `PhysicsServer3D` before raycast ([net_lag_compensation.gd](scripts/net_lag_compensation.gd)).
- **Input send rate** — WHY: 60 Hz input RPCs saturate uplink; batch at 20–30 Hz with significance checks ([net_delta_compression_sync.gd](scripts/net_delta_compression_sync.gd)).

## Decision Tree: Which Architecture?

| Factor | Authoritative Server | P2P Lockstep |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| Player count | 8-100+ | 2-4 |
| Cheat prevention | Critical | Not important |
| Server hosting | Available | Not available |
| Gameplay type | PvP, competitive | Co-op, casual |
| Lag tolerance | Medium (prediction helps) | Low (desyncs) |
| Development complexity | High | Medium |

## Advanced Networking Topics

### Peer-to-Peer NAT Traversal (Hole Punching)
In P2P architectures, clients often sit behind firewalls. **UPNP** (Universal Plug and Play) is the first line of defense, allowing the game to request port forwarding from the router automatically using `net_upnp_discovery_logic.gd`.

For cases where UPNP fails:
- **STUN/TURN**: Use a STUN server to discover public IP/port pairings.
- **Relay Servers**: If direct connection is impossible, fallback to a relay server (TURN) to bridge the two peers.

### Network Profiling & Visualization
Visualizing the packet timeline is critical for debugging jitter. Propose an overlay that graphs:
- **Packet Arrival**: A scrolling timeline showing when packets arrive relative to physics frames.
- **Buffer Health**: A visualization of the interpolation jitter buffer size.
- **RTT (Round Trip Time)**: Real-time graph of latency spikes.
